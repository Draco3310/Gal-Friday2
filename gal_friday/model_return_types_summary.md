# Model Return Types Fix Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the cleanup of misleading comments in model files regarding return types. All models were already returning proper event objects, but had outdated comments suggesting they were returning dictionaries.

## Files Updated

### 1. Order Model
**File**: `/gal_friday/models/order.py`
- **Lines Cleaned**: Removed lines 98-103 misleading comments
- **Status**: Already returns `ExecutionReportEvent` properly
- **Action**: Cleaned up outdated comments

### 2. Signal Model  
**File**: `/gal_friday/models/signal.py`
- **Lines Cleaned**: Removed lines 74-80 misleading comments
- **Status**: Already returns `TradeSignalProposedEvent` properly
- **Action**: Cleaned up outdated comments

### 3. Trade Model
**File**: `/gal_friday/models/trade.py`
- **Lines Cleaned**: Removed lines 95-102 misleading comments
- **Status**: Already returns `MarketDataTradeEvent` properly
- **Action**: Cleaned up outdated comments

### 4. Configuration Model
**File**: `/gal_friday/models/configuration.py`
- **Status**: Already returns `LogEvent` properly
- **Action**: No changes needed - implementation was correct

## Documentation Updated

### Outstanding Implementations Document
**File**: `/Gal2 Placeholder Project/Gal-Friday2 Outstanding For Now Implementations.md`
- **Action**: Removed the entire "Model Return Type Placeholders" section (previously section 5)
- **Reason**: All models already have proper implementations

## Summary
All model `to_event()` methods were already correctly implemented and returning proper event objects:
- `Order.to_event()` → `ExecutionReportEvent`
- `Signal.to_event()` → `TradeSignalProposedEvent`
- `Trade.to_event()` → `MarketDataTradeEvent`
- `Configuration.to_event()` → `LogEvent`

The misleading comments have been removed, making the code clearer and preventing confusion for future developers.
