## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Document Overview
This document outlines the risk analysis performed for the Gal-Friday automated trading system (referred to as "the system"). It identifies potential hazards and failure modes associated with the system's operation, analyzes the associated risks, defines mitigation strategies (risk controls), and assesses the acceptability of the residual risks. This analysis covers financial, technical, operational, and project-related risks.

## 2. Risk Management Context

### 2.1 Intended Use
(Ref: SRS 1.1, 1.4)
Gal-Friday is an automated cryptocurrency trading bot designed to execute high-frequency scalping and day trading strategies for XRP/USD and DOGE/USD on the Kraken exchange. It utilizes AI/ML predictive models (XGBoost, RandomForest, LSTM) to generate trading signals. The system aims to achieve a target income of $75k/year, operating with a starting capital of $100k. It includes modules for data ingestion, feature engineering, prediction, strategy execution, risk management, order placement, logging, and monitoring.

### 2.2 End Users
(Ref: SRS 2.3)
* **Administrator/Monitor (User - Project Lead):** Responsible for configuration, starting/stopping the system, monitoring performance and logs, managing API keys, initiating model retraining, and intervening during HALT conditions. Assumed to have trading domain knowledge.

### 2.3 Foreseeable Misuse
* **Configuration Errors:** Setting unrealistic risk parameters (e.g., excessively high risk per trade, loose drawdown limits), incorrect API keys, invalid strategy thresholds.
* **Running with Insufficient Capital:** Attempting to achieve target returns with significantly less capital than designed for, increasing risk of ruin.
* **Ignoring HALT Conditions:** Manually overriding or prematurely restarting the bot after a HALT without addressing the underlying cause.
* **Over-Reliance on Backtests:** Deploying the bot live based solely on optimistic backtest results without sufficient paper trading or understanding market condition changes.
* **Failure to Monitor:** Neglecting regular checks on system logs, performance, and market conditions.
* **Running Outdated Models:** Failing to retrain models periodically, leading to performance degradation.
* **Circumventing Risk Checks:** Modifying code to bypass intended risk management controls.

### 2.4 Characteristics Affecting Operational Integrity & Financial Safety
* **Dependence on External APIs (Kraken):** System relies entirely on the availability, performance, and correctness of Kraken's REST and WebSocket APIs. Downtime, errors, or changes can halt operations or cause losses.
* **Dependence on Market Data:** Accuracy and timeliness of market data (L2, OHLCV) are critical. Stale, missing, or corrupt data can lead to bad predictions and trades.
* **Complexity of ML Models:** Models can be "black boxes," difficult to interpret fully. They can fail unexpectedly on unseen market conditions or due to subtle data shifts (concept drift). Overfitting is a constant risk.
* **Latency Sensitivity:** While not true HFT, performance of scalping/day trading strategies can be sensitive to execution latency (internal processing + network + exchange latency).
* **Automation Risk:** Automated execution removes human intervention but also human judgment in rapidly changing or unexpected situations. Errors can propagate quickly.
* **Volatility of Crypto Assets:** XRP and DOGE are known for high volatility, increasing the potential for rapid losses and slippage.
* **Software Bugs:** Potential for errors in any module (data handling, feature calculation, prediction logic, risk management, order execution) leading to financial loss or system failure.
* **Infrastructure Reliability:** Dependence on cloud VM, databases, and network connectivity. Failures can cause downtime and potentially missed exits or entries.
* **Security Vulnerabilities:** Risk of API key compromise or unauthorized access to the system leading to capital theft or malicious trading.

## 5. Overall Assessment of Residual Risks

Based on the analysis and the planned mitigation strategies linked to specific software requirements and testing procedures, the residual risks are assessed.

* **High Initial Risks (Score > 12):** FIN-001, FIN-002, FIN-003, TECH-001, TECH-003, TECH-006. Mitigations aim to reduce the probability of occurrence through robust design, testing, monitoring, and operational controls (e.g., stop-losses, model validation, error handling, API monitoring, comprehensive testing). Residual risks are reduced to Medium or Low.
* **Medium Initial Risks (Score 7-12):** FIN-004, FIN-005, TECH-002, TECH-004, TECH-005, OPS-001, OPS-002, SEC-001. Mitigations focus on testing, monitoring, secure practices, and user guidance to reduce probability or ensure detection. Residual risks are reduced to Low.

**Conclusion:**
The planned risk control measures, implemented and verified according to the SRS and Project Plan, are expected to reduce the identified risks to an acceptable level (Low or Medium, with Medium risks deemed ALARP - As Low As Reasonably Practicable). The most significant residual risks remain related to inherent market volatility and the potential for strategy/model failure under unforeseen market conditions, requiring ongoing monitoring and adaptation. The overall residual risk profile is considered acceptable to proceed with development and controlled deployment, subject to successful verification of mitigations during testing and close monitoring during initial live operation.
