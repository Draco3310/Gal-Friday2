## 9. Conclusion

The Gal-Friday codebase demonstrates solid architectural design and good coding practices in many areas. However, several critical gaps prevent it from being production-ready. The most pressing concerns are the complete absence of tests, incomplete HALT mechanisms, and security vulnerabilities.

The development team has created a strong foundation, but significant work remains to meet all SRS requirements and ensure safe, reliable operation in a production trading environment. With focused effort on the critical and high-priority items, the system could be brought to production readiness.

**Overall Assessment: The system is approximately 70% complete relative to SRS requirements, with critical safety and quality assurance features being the primary gaps.**
