# High Priority Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document provides a consolidated implementation plan for all high priority issues identified in the Gal-Friday cryptocurrency trading system. These solutions address critical gaps in model management, data consistency, real-time capabilities, and persistence.

## High Priority Issues Summary

### 1. Model Lifecycle Management
**Impact**: Critical for maintaining prediction accuracy and enabling continuous improvement
- **Current State**: Models stored as files without versioning, no A/B testing, manual retraining
- **Solution**: Complete model registry with versioning, A/B testing framework, automated retraining with drift detection
- **Effort**: 12 days

### 2. Portfolio Reconciliation
**Impact**: Essential for accurate position tracking and risk management
- **Current State**: Single source of truth in memory, no validation against exchange
- **Solution**: Automated reconciliation service with discrepancy detection and auto-correction
- **Effort**: 10 days

### 3. WebSocket Order Updates
**Impact**: Reduces latency from 1-5 seconds to <100ms for order updates
- **Current State**: HTTP polling wastes API limits and introduces delays
- **Solution**: Full WebSocket implementation for real-time order and market data
- **Effort**: 10 days

### 4. Database Integrations
**Impact**: Enables data persistence, scalability, and recovery
- **Current State**: In-memory storage leads to data loss on restart
- **Solution**: PostgreSQL and InfluxDB integration throughout the system
- **Effort**: 8 days
