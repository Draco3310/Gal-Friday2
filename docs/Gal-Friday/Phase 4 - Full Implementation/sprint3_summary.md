## Integration Verification

### Model Prediction → Trading Signal Flow
The existing `StrategyArbitrator` properly consumes `PredictionEvent` objects:

1. **PredictionEvent Reception**:
   ```python
   # From strategy_arbitrator.py
   async def handle_prediction_event(self, event: PredictionEvent) -> None:
       # Validates prediction_value and trading_pair
       # Applies strategy logic based on thresholds
       # Generates TradeSignalProposedEvent
   ```

2. **Strategy Application**:
   - Supports multiple interpretation modes (prob_up, prob_down, price_change_pct)
   - Applies confirmation rules from associated features
   - Calculates stop-loss and take-profit levels
   - Determines order type (MARKET/LIMIT)

3. **Signal Generation**:
   - Creates `TradeSignalProposedEvent` with all parameters
   - Publishes to PubSub for downstream processing
