# Utils Folder (`gal_friday/utils`) Documentation

## Folder Overview

The `gal_friday/utils` folder serves as a central repository for a collection of shared, reusable utility functions and classes that provide support across various modules and services within the Gal-Friday trading application. These utilities are designed to address common, cross-cutting concerns such as application configuration validation, secure management of sensitive credentials, low-level API interaction details, performance optimization, and standardized error handling. By centralizing these functionalities, the `utils` folder promotes code reuse, reduces redundancy, and helps keep domain-specific modules focused on their core responsibilities.

## Key Modules and Their Roles

The `utils` folder contains several modules, each addressing a specific set of common problems:

### `config_validator.py` (`ConfigValidator` class)

-   **Purpose:** Provides tools and logic for validating the application's configuration, which is typically loaded from a YAML file (e.g., `config.yaml`) by `ConfigManager`.
-   **Functionality:**
    -   **Schema Validation:** Checks for the presence of required configuration sections and parameters (e.g., `database` settings, `risk_manager` limits, `trading_pairs`).
    -   **Data Type and Range Checks:** Validates that configuration values adhere to expected data types (e.g., integers, floats, booleans, lists) and fall within acceptable ranges or predefined sets of allowed values (e.g., risk limits must be positive, order types must be from a specific enum).
    -   **URL Configurability:** Ensures that external service URLs (e.g., for exchange APIs, database connections) are configurable and not hardcoded.
    -   **Sensitive Value Warnings:** Scans configuration content for potentially hardcoded sensitive values (like API keys or passwords, though these should ideally be managed by `SecretsManager`) and issues warnings.
    -   **Secret Scanning Utility:** May include a utility function to scan specified files or directories for patterns matching common secret formats to help prevent accidental commitment of sensitive data to version control.
-   **Importance:** Ensures that the application starts with a valid and secure configuration, preventing runtime errors or misconfigurations that could lead to financial loss or security vulnerabilities.

### `kraken_api.py` (Utility functions & custom exceptions)

-   **Purpose:** Provides a set of low-level helper functions and custom exception types specifically for interacting with the Kraken cryptocurrency exchange API. This module is typically used by more specialized Kraken service implementations like `KrakenExecutionHandler` or `KrakenMarketPriceService`.
-   **Functionality:**
    -   **`generate_kraken_signature(uri_path, data, secret) -> str`**: Implements Kraken's specific algorithm for generating the API request signature (HMAC-SHA512) required for authenticated private API calls.
    -   **`prepare_kraken_request_data(params: dict) -> dict`**: Adds a nonce (a unique, increasing integer) to the request parameters, which is a requirement for Kraken's private API calls.
    -   **Custom Exceptions:**
        -   `KrakenAPIError(Exception)`: A base exception for errors returned by the Kraken API.
        -   `InvalidAPISecretError(KrakenAPIError)`: Specifically for errors related to invalid API secret keys.
-   **Importance:** Encapsulates the very specific and often complex details of Kraken API authentication and request formatting, making it easier for higher-level services to interact with Kraken without repeatedly implementing this boilerplate logic.

### `performance_optimizer.py` (`PerformanceOptimizer`, `LRUCache`, `ConnectionPool`, `QueryOptimizer`, `MemoryOptimizer` classes; `@cached`, `@rate_limited`, `@timed` decorators)

-   **Purpose:** Offers a collection of tools, data structures, and strategies aimed at monitoring, analyzing, and optimizing the performance of the Gal-Friday application.
-   **Key Components & Functionality:**
    -   **`LRUCache` Class:** A thread-safe (often using `asyncio.Lock` for asynchronous contexts) implementation of a Least Recently Used (LRU) cache. Useful for caching the results of expensive computations or frequently accessed data that changes infrequently.
    -   **`ConnectionPool` Class (Generic Template):** Provides a generic asynchronous connection pool implementation that can be adapted for various types of connections (e.g., database connections if not using SQLAlchemy's built-in pool, or connections to other external services).
    -   **`QueryOptimizer` Class (Placeholder/Interface):** Intended as a placeholder or interface for utilities that could analyze or optimize database queries, perhaps by suggesting indexes or rewriting inefficient query patterns.
    -   **`MemoryOptimizer` Class:**
        -   Monitors the application's memory usage (leveraging `psutil`).
        -   Can be configured to trigger Python's garbage collection (`gc.collect()`) proactively if memory usage exceeds certain thresholds or shows problematic patterns.
    -   **`PerformanceOptimizer` Class (Orchestrator):**
        -   May orchestrate the use of the above components.
        -   Can run a background monitoring loop to periodically check performance metrics, log them, or trigger alerts/optimizations.
    -   **Decorators:**
        -   **`@cached(cache_instance)`**: A decorator to easily apply LRU caching to the results of a function.
        -   **`@rate_limited(calls, period)`**: A decorator to enforce rate limits on function calls, preventing excessive requests to external APIs or resource-intensive operations.
        -   **`@timed`**: A decorator (or context manager) to measure and log the execution time of functions or code blocks, aiding in performance profiling.
-   **Importance:** Provides developers with tools to enhance application responsiveness, reduce latency, manage resource consumption effectively, and ensure that third-party API rate limits are respected.

### `secrets_manager.py` (`SecretsManager` class, `SecretsBackend` ABC, `EnvironmentBackend`, `EncryptedFileBackend`, `GCPSecretsBackend`)

-   **Purpose:** Centralizes the secure management, storage, and retrieval of sensitive credentials such as API keys, database passwords, and other secrets required by the application.
-   **Key Components & Functionality:**
    -   **`SecretsBackend` (Abstract Base Class):** Defines a standard interface for different secret storage backends, requiring methods like `get_secret(key: str) -> Optional[str]`.
    -   **Concrete Backend Implementations:**
        -   **`EnvironmentBackend`**: Retrieves secrets from environment variables.
        -   **`EncryptedFileBackend`**: Retrieves secrets from a local file that is encrypted (e.g., using Fernet symmetric encryption, with the master encryption key provided via an environment variable or another secure mechanism).
        -   **`GCPSecretsBackend` (Google Cloud Secrets Manager):** Retrieves secrets from Google Cloud Secret Manager.
        -   (Potentially others like `VaultBackend` for HashiCorp Vault, `AWSSecretsManagerBackend`).
    -   **`SecretsManager` Class:**
        -   **Unified Access:** Provides a single point of access for other services to request secrets (e.g., `secrets_manager.get_secret("kraken_api_key")`).
        -   **Backend Priority:** Manages a list of configured backends and attempts to retrieve secrets from them in a defined order of priority (e.g., first try environment variable, then GCP Secret Manager, then encrypted file).
        -   **Caching (Optional):** May cache retrieved secrets in memory for a short period to reduce latency, with appropriate security considerations.
        -   **Secret Storage/Rotation (Advanced):** In more advanced setups, might include methods for securely storing new secrets or interfacing with backend rotation mechanisms.
        -   **Audit Logging:** Maintains an audit log (e.g., via `LoggerService`) of secret access requests (who requested what, when, and if it was successful), which is crucial for security monitoring.
-   **Importance:** Drastically improves the security posture of the application by abstracting away how secrets are stored and preventing them from being hardcoded in configuration files or source code. Provides flexibility in choosing secret storage solutions based on the deployment environment.

### `__init__.py`

-   **Purpose:** Marks the `utils` directory as a Python package.
-   **Key Aspects:**
    -   Allows modules and their components within `utils` to be imported using package notation (e.g., `from gal_friday.utils.secrets_manager import SecretsManager`).
    -   Often exports key utility classes or functions from its modules to make them directly accessible at the `gal_friday.utils` package level (e.g., `from .kraken_api import generate_kraken_signature`).
    -   **Generic Exception Handling Decorators:** This `__init__.py` might also define generic exception handling decorators like `handle_exceptions` (for synchronous functions) and `handle_exceptions_async` (for asynchronous functions). These decorators can be applied to methods in other services to provide standardized logging of exceptions and optionally re-raise them or return a default value, reducing boilerplate error handling code.

## Cross-Cutting Concerns Addressed

The utilities within this folder address several important cross-cutting concerns that affect multiple parts of the application:

-   **Configuration Integrity:** `config_validator.py` ensures that the system starts with a correct and secure configuration, preventing many common runtime issues.
-   **Security:** `secrets_manager.py` provides a foundational layer for secure credential management, significantly reducing the risk of secret exposure. The secret scanning parts of `config_validator.py` also contribute to this.
-   **API Abstraction & Standardization:** Modules like `kraken_api.py` help in abstracting and standardizing parts of exchange-specific communication, making higher-level code cleaner.
-   **Performance & Resource Management:** `performance_optimizer.py` offers tools to directly enhance application speed, manage caching, control resource usage, and respect external service rate limits.
-   **Standardized Error Handling:** Decorators potentially defined in `utils/__init__.py` allow for consistent logging and management of exceptions across different services.
