# Ensemble Prediction Testing Plan

## Overview

This document outlines a comprehensive testing approach for the ensemble prediction capabilities implemented in the PredictionService. The testing strategy covers unit tests for specific components as well as integration tests to verify end-to-end functionality.

## 1. Unit Testing

### 1.1 Ensemble Configuration Testing

- **Test ensemble configuration parsing**
  - Verify correct loading of ensemble configurations from various formats
  - Test handling of invalid or incomplete ensemble configurations
  - Validate detection of circular dependencies between ensembles

- **Test ensemble-model matching**
  - Verify `_find_matching_ensembles` correctly identifies ensembles for specific trading pairs
  - Test prioritization when multiple ensembles match a single event
  - Validate handling of partial matches (e.g., when some but not all referenced models are available)

### 1.2 Prediction Combination Testing

- **Test average strategy**
  - Verify correct calculation for equal weights
  - Test behavior with outlier values
  - Validate handling when some model predictions are missing

- **Test weighted strategy**
  - Verify weighted average calculation with various weight distributions
  - Test normalization of weights
  - Validate handling of zero weights
  - Test precision in calculations using Decimal

- **Test error handling**
  - Verify graceful handling when a model fails to produce a prediction
  - Test behavior when all models fail
  - Validate logging of model failures

### 1.3 Configuration Extensibility Testing

- **Test adding new ensemble strategies**
  - Verify the implementation allows for new strategies beyond average and weighted
  - Test a custom ensemble strategy implementation
  - Validate configuration-driven strategy selection

## 2. Integration Testing

### 2.1 End-to-End Pipeline Testing

- **Test feature event to prediction event flow**
  - Verify full pipeline from feature event ingestion to ensemble prediction event publication
  - Test with multiple configured ensembles for the same trading pair
  - Validate correct metadata propagation through the pipeline

- **Test dynamic model reloading in ensemble context**
  - Verify ensembles recalculate correctly after models are reloaded
  - Test behavior when a model becomes unavailable during operation
  - Validate recovery when a previously unavailable model becomes available again

### 2.2 Multi-Model Type Testing

- **Test ensembles with different model types**
  - Verify ensembles combining XGBoost and sklearn models
  - Test with models having different feature requirements
  - Validate normalization of prediction outputs from different model types

- **Test preprocessing pipeline with ensembles**
  - Verify preprocessing configuration is correctly applied per model
  - Test shared preprocessing across ensemble models
  - Validate handling of model-specific preprocessing requirements

### 2.3 Performance Testing

- **Test ensemble processing efficiency**
  - Measure processing time for various ensemble sizes
  - Test parallelization of model predictions within an ensemble
  - Validate memory usage during ensemble processing

- **Test high-frequency prediction scenarios**
  - Verify system performance under high event volume
  - Test backpressure handling with multiple ensembles
  - Validate resource cleanup after processing

### 2.4 Strategy Component Integration

- **Test integration with StrategyArbitrator**
  - Verify StrategyArbitrator correctly processes ensemble predictions
  - Test various prediction formats and interpretations
  - Validate threshold-based decision making with ensemble outputs

- **Test integration with RiskManager**
  - Verify RiskManager correctly handles trade signals based on ensemble predictions
  - Test confidence handling from ensemble predictions
  - Validate risk calculations based on ensemble prediction quality

## 3. Fault Tolerance and Recovery Testing

- **Test partial ensemble failures**
  - Verify behavior when some models in an ensemble are unavailable
  - Test recovery when models become available again
  - Validate minimum model count requirements for ensemble operation

- **Test process pool failures**
  - Verify handling of worker process crashes during prediction
  - Test recovery and resubmission of prediction tasks
  - Validate cleanup of abandoned tasks

## 4. Test Coverage Guidelines

For sufficient test coverage of the ensemble prediction functionality:

1. **Core Components**: 100% coverage of ensemble-specific methods
   - `_find_matching_ensembles`
   - `_combine_predictions`
   - `_run_ensemble_pipeline`

2. **Error Handling**: At least 90% coverage of error handling paths
   - Model loading failures
   - Prediction failures
   - Configuration errors

3. **Edge Cases**: Test specific edge cases
   - Empty feature sets
   - Single-model ensembles
   - Large ensembles (5+ models)
   - Very large weight disparities (e.g., 0.99 vs 0.01)

## 5. Test Implementation Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**: Create focused test modules for each aspect of ensemble functionality
   - `test_ensemble_configuration.py`
   - `test_prediction_combination.py`
   - `test_ensemble_error_handling.py`

2. **Integration Tests**: Create broader test scenarios combining multiple components
   - `test_ensemble_pipeline_e2e.py`
   - `test_multi_model_ensembles.py`
   - `test_ensemble_performance.py`

3. **Mock Components**: Use appropriate mocking for external dependencies
   - Mock predictors for testing combination logic
   - Mock PubSub for testing event flow
   - Mock actual model inference to isolate ensemble logic

4. **Test Data**: Create standard test fixtures
   - Sample FeatureEvents for various trading pairs
   - Mock model results with known output values
   - Configurations for different ensemble types

## 6. Automated Test Execution

Integrate the ensemble tests into the CI/CD pipeline with the following steps:

1. Run unit tests on every commit
2. Run integration tests on pull requests and before deployment
3. Run performance tests weekly and before major releases
4. Generate coverage reports and flag any dropping coverage in ensemble functionality

## 7. Documentation Requirements

Ensure all ensemble functionality is documented with:

1. Function and method docstrings explaining parameters and return values
2. Example configurations for different ensemble types
3. Debug logging for ensemble operations
4. Performance characteristics and limitations
