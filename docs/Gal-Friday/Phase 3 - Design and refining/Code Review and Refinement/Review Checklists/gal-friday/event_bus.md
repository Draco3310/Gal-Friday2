# Event Bus Module Code Review Checklist

## Module Overview
The `event_bus.py` module implements the internal event bus that serves as the backbone of the event-driven architecture in Gal-Friday. It is responsible for:
- Facilitating asynchronous, decoupled communication between modules
- Managing subscriptions to different event types
- Handling the publication of events to relevant subscribers
- Ensuring reliable event delivery
- Providing strong typing and clear interfaces for events

## Module Importance
This module is **critically important** as it enables the event-driven architecture at the core of the system's design. All inter-module communication flows through this component, making it essential for the correct functioning of the entire trading system.

## Architectural Context
According to the [architecture_concept](../../../../Phase%201%20-%20Requirements%20Analysis%20%26%20Planning/architecture_concept_gal_friday_v0.1.md), the `EventBus` serves as the primary mechanism for communication between modules in the Modular Monolith architecture. It is used throughout the system to enable loose coupling between components while maintaining high performance for critical trading operations.

## Review Checklist

### A. Correctness & Logic

- [ ] Verify that the implementation aligns with the `EventBus` interface defined in section 2.13 of the [interface_definitions](../../../../Phase%201%20-%20Requirements%20Analysis%20%26%20Planning/interface_definitions_gal_friday_v0.1.md) document
- [ ] Check that the `publish` method correctly delivers events to all subscribed handlers
- [ ] Verify that the `subscribe` method properly registers handlers for specific event types
- [ ] Ensure that the `unsubscribe` method correctly removes handlers
- [ ] Verify that event typing and validation are correctly implemented
- [ ] Check that event delivery maintains the order of publication for each subscriber
- [ ] Verify that the implementation supports all event types defined in the [inter_module_comm](../../../../Phase%201%20-%20Requirements%20Analysis%20%26%20Planning/inter_module_comm_gal_friday_v0.1.md) document (sections 3.1-3.10)

### B. Error Handling & Robustness

- [ ] Check for proper exception handling during event publishing
- [ ] Verify that failures in one subscriber don't affect delivery to other subscribers
- [ ] Ensure that exceptions in handler coroutines are properly caught and logged
- [ ] Check for appropriate error logging with context
- [ ] Verify proper validation of event payloads before delivery
- [ ] Ensure the event bus maintains stability under high event volumes

### C. asyncio Usage

- [ ] Verify correct usage of asyncio primitives (queues, tasks, coroutines)
- [ ] Check for proper task creation and management for event dispatching
- [ ] Ensure awaitable methods return appropriately
- [ ] Verify that long-running event handlers don't block the event loop
- [ ] Check for proper handling of CancelledError exceptions during shutdown
- [ ] Ensure proper implementation of asynchronous publish and subscribe methods

### D. Dependencies & Imports

- [ ] Verify that imports are well-organized and follow project standards
- [ ] Check that the module has minimal external dependencies
- [ ] Ensure the module appropriately uses the core events module if applicable
- [ ] Verify proper use of typing imports for type hinting
- [ ] Check for potential circular dependencies with other modules

### E. Configuration & Hardcoding

- [ ] Verify that any configurable parameters (e.g., queue sizes, dispatch policies) are loaded from configuration
- [ ] Check for hardcoded values that should be configurable
- [ ] Ensure sensible defaults for unconfigured parameters
- [ ] Check that any debug or development flags are configurable

### F. Logging

- [ ] Verify appropriate logging of subscription and unsubscription activities
- [ ] Check for logging of significant events (e.g., high event volumes, delivery delays)
- [ ] Ensure error conditions are logged with sufficient context
- [ ] Verify that logging is not excessive for normal operations
- [ ] Check that log levels are appropriate for different event bus activities

### G. Readability & Style

- [ ] Verify clear, descriptive method and variable names
- [ ] Check for well-structured code organization
- [ ] Ensure complex event delivery logic is well-commented
- [ ] Verify reasonable method length and complexity
- [ ] Check for helpful comments explaining non-obvious design decisions

### H. Resource Management

- [ ] Verify proper management of internal queues or buffers
- [ ] Check for memory leaks, especially in subscription handling
- [ ] Ensure proper cleanup of resources during shutdown
- [ ] Verify that the module handles high event volumes without excessive memory usage
- [ ] Check for proper cancellation of background tasks during cleanup

### I. Docstrings & Type Hinting

- [ ] Ensure comprehensive docstrings for the class and all public methods
- [ ] Verify accurate type hints for event types and handler signatures
- [ ] Check for clear documentation of the subscribe/publish patterns
- [ ] Ensure proper generic type usage for flexible event handling
- [ ] Verify that the module's public API is well-documented

### J. Performance Considerations

- [ ] Verify that event dispatch is optimized for low latency
- [ ] Check that high event volumes can be handled efficiently
- [ ] Ensure the implementation doesn't become a bottleneck for the critical trading path
- [ ] Verify that the system meets the latency requirements specified in NFR-501 (under 100ms for data processing)
- [ ] Consider the overhead of event serialization/deserialization if applicable

### K. Threading & Concurrency

- [ ] Verify that the event bus handles concurrent access properly
- [ ] Check for thread-safe operations if running in a multi-threaded context
- [ ] Ensure that event handlers are executed appropriately (e.g., sequential for same subscriber)
- [ ] Verify proper synchronization of shared resources if applicable

## Improvement Suggestions

- [ ] Consider adding event prioritization for critical trading events
- [ ] Evaluate adding dead letter queue for undeliverable or failed events
- [ ] Consider implementing event replay capability for error recovery
- [ ] Evaluate adding metrics/instrumentation for event flow monitoring
- [ ] Consider implementing backpressure handling for subscribers that can't keep up
- [ ] Evaluate adding support for wildcard subscriptions or pattern matching
- [ ] Consider implementing event persistence for critical events
