# Prediction Service Module Code Review Checklist

## Module Overview
The `prediction_service.py` module is responsible for consuming feature events from the Feature Engine, running machine learning models to generate predictions, and publishing prediction events for downstream consumption. It handles:
- Loading and managing pre-trained ML models
- Processing incoming feature vectors from the Feature Engine
- Performing inference using models (potentially offloading to separate processes)
- Generating and publishing prediction events with probability scores
- Managing model selection and ensemble logic

## Module Importance
This module is **highly important** as it applies the machine learning models that form the core predictive intelligence of the system. The quality and correctness of these predictions directly influence the trading decisions and overall system performance.

## Architectural Context
According to the [architecture_concept](../../../../Phase%201%20-%20Requirements%20Analysis%20%26%20Planning/architecture_concept_gal_friday_v0.1.md), the `PredictionService` is the third module in the data processing pipeline. It receives feature events from the `FeatureEngine` and produces prediction events for the `StrategyArbitrator`. It also uses a process pool to offload CPU-intensive ML inference tasks.

## Review Checklist
