# Strategy Arbitrator Module Code Review Checklist

## Module Overview
The `strategy_arbitrator.py` module is responsible for consuming prediction events from the Prediction Service, applying trading strategy rules, and generating trade signal proposals. It handles:
- Processing incoming prediction events
- Applying configurable strategy rules and thresholds
- Determining entry signals (BUY/SELL)
- Calculating preliminary Stop-Loss and Take-Profit levels
- Publishing trade signal proposals for risk assessment

## Module Importance
This module is **highly important** as it translates model predictions into actionable trading decisions. It defines the trading strategy logic that determines when to enter trades and sets the initial risk/reward parameters through SL/TP placement.

## Architectural Context
According to the [architecture_concept](../../../../Phase%201%20-%20Requirements%20Analysis%20%26%20Planning/architecture_concept_gal_friday_v0.1.md), the `StrategyArbitrator` is the fourth module in the data processing pipeline. It receives prediction events from the `PredictionService` and produces trade signal proposals for the `RiskManager` to evaluate.

## Review Checklist

### A. Correctness & Logic

- [ ] Verify that the implementation conforms to the `StrategyArbitrator` interface defined in section 2.4 of the [interface_definitions](../../../../Phase%201%20-%20Requirements%20Analysis%20%26%20Planning/interface_definitions_gal_friday_v0.1.md) document
- [ ] Check that the module correctly consumes prediction events from the event bus
- [ ] Verify implementation of the primary strategy rule based on prediction probability thresholds as specified in FR-402 (e.g., > 65% for BUY, < 35% for SELL)
- [ ] Check implementation of secondary confirmation conditions if required per FR-403
- [ ] Ensure correct determination of preliminary Stop-Loss and Take-Profit levels as specified in FR-404
- [ ] Verify that trade signal proposals contain all required information (asset, side, preliminary SL/TP) per FR-405
- [ ] Check that the module publishes properly formatted trade signal proposal events as defined in section 3.5 of the [inter_module_comm](../../../../Phase%201%20-%20Requirements%20Analysis%20%26%20Planning/inter_module_comm_gal_friday_v0.1.md) document
- [ ] Verify implementation of trade exit logic based on SL/TP monitoring if applicable per FR-407
- [ ] Check implementation of additional exit conditions (time-based, prediction reversal) if specified in FR-408

### B. Error Handling & Robustness

- [ ] Check for proper handling of invalid prediction events
- [ ] Verify handling of edge cases in prediction values (NaN, extreme values)
- [ ] Ensure that errors in strategy evaluation don't crash the module
- [ ] Check handling of market conditions where SL/TP cannot be reasonably determined
- [ ] Verify that the system can recover from temporary error conditions
- [ ] Ensure proper handling of missing or incomplete prediction data
- [ ] Check that errors are logged with appropriate context for debugging

### C. asyncio Usage

- [ ] Verify correct usage of asyncio patterns for event handling
- [ ] Ensure that strategy evaluation doesn't block the event loop with complex calculations
- [ ] Verify proper handling of CancelledError during shutdown
- [ ] Check that trade signal publishing follows proper async patterns
- [ ] Ensure proper cleanup of resources and tasks during the stop method

### D. Dependencies & Imports

- [ ] Verify that imports are well-organized according to project standards
- [ ] Ensure proper import and usage of the event bus/subscription mechanism
- [ ] Verify proper use of typing imports for type hinting
- [ ] Check that dependencies are used efficiently and appropriately

### E. Configuration & Hardcoding

- [ ] Verify that strategy threshold parameters are configurable (e.g., probability thresholds for BUY/SELL)
- [ ] Check that SL/TP calculation parameters are configurable
- [ ] Ensure that secondary confirmation conditions are configurable
- [ ] Verify that any time-based parameters (maximum holding periods) are configurable
- [ ] Check that no critical strategy parameters are hardcoded

### F. Logging

- [ ] Verify appropriate logging of strategy decisions (trade signals generated)
- [ ] Ensure that rejected predictions (those not meeting thresholds) are logged at appropriate levels
- [ ] Check for logging of SL/TP determination logic
- [ ] Verify logging of key values used in decision making
- [ ] Ensure logging doesn't impact performance of time-critical operations

### G. Readability & Style

- [ ] Verify clear, descriptive method and variable names
- [ ] Check for well-structured code organization, especially for different strategy components
- [ ] Ensure complex decision logic is well-commented
- [ ] Verify reasonable method length and complexity
- [ ] Check for helpful comments explaining strategy rules and rationale

### H. Resource Management

- [ ] Verify efficient management of any data structures needed for strategy evaluation
- [ ] Check for cleanup of any resources upon shutdown
- [ ] Ensure any background tasks are properly tracked and cancelled during shutdown
- [ ] Check for potential memory leaks in long-running operations

### I. Docstrings & Type Hinting

- [ ] Ensure comprehensive docstrings for the class and all methods
- [ ] Verify accurate type hints for method parameters and return values
- [ ] Check that strategy rules and logic are well-documented
- [ ] Ensure trade signal proposal structures are well-documented
- [ ] Verify that public methods have complete parameter and return value documentation

### J. Strategy-Specific Considerations

- [ ] Verify that the strategy logic aligns with the system's goals (scalping/day trading)
- [ ] Check that SL/TP levels are realistic and align with the prediction target
- [ ] Ensure that the strategy doesn't generate excessive trading signals
- [ ] Verify that the strategy handles different market conditions appropriately
- [ ] Check that the risk/reward ratio in SL/TP placement is reasonable
- [ ] Ensure that any filtering or confirmation logic improves signal quality
- [ ] Verify that the strategy properly processes model confidence information if available

### K. Performance Considerations

- [ ] Verify that strategy evaluation is efficient and doesn't cause delays
- [ ] Check for any unnecessary computation or data processing
- [ ] Ensure that the strategy meets the latency requirements in the processing pipeline
- [ ] Verify that the module can handle the expected frequency of prediction events

## Improvement Suggestions

- [ ] Consider implementing multiple strategy variants that can be selected or combined
- [ ] Evaluate adding dynamic threshold adjustment based on market volatility
- [ ] Consider implementing more sophisticated SL/TP placement strategies
- [ ] Evaluate adding position sizing hints based on prediction confidence
- [ ] Consider implementing a strategy backtest mode for rapid evaluation
- [ ] Assess adding trade signal quality metrics
- [ ] Consider implementing market regime detection to adjust strategy parameters
- [ ] Evaluate adding correlation with alternative data sources for signal confirmation
