# Portfolio Manager Module Code Review Checklist

## Module Overview
The `portfolio_manager.py` module is responsible for maintaining an accurate, real-time record of the trading account's portfolio state, including cash balance, positions, equity, and P&L metrics. It handles:
- Consuming execution report events from the Execution Handler
- Tracking current cash balance and positions
- Calculating real-time equity, realized and unrealized P&L
- Calculating drawdown metrics (daily, weekly, total)
- Providing consistent portfolio state to the Risk Manager for pre-trade checks
- Reconciling internal state with the exchange periodically

## Module Importance
This module is **critically important** as it maintains the accurate financial state of the trading account. It provides the basis for all risk decisions and serves as the single source of truth for portfolio information.

## Architectural Context
According to the [architecture_concept](../../../../Phase%201%20-%20Requirements%20Analysis%20%26%20Planning/architecture_concept_gal_friday_v0.1.md), the `PortfolioManager` consumes execution reports from the `ExecutionHandler` to update its state, and provides synchronous access to the `RiskManager` for pre-trade checks, ensuring consistent risk assessment based on the latest portfolio information.

## Review Checklist

### A. Correctness & Logic

- [ ] Verify that the implementation conforms to the `PortfolioManager` interface defined in section 2.5 of the [interface_definitions](../../../../Phase%201%20-%20Requirements%20Analysis%20%26%20Planning/interface_definitions_gal_friday_v0.1.md) document
- [ ] Check that the module correctly consumes execution report events from the event bus
- [ ] Verify accurate maintenance of cash balance and positions as specified in FR-701 and FR-702
- [ ] Ensure proper calculation of total equity (Cash + Market Value of Positions) per FR-703
- [ ] Check correct calculation of realized and unrealized P&L per FR-704
- [ ] Verify that the `get_current_state` method provides all required information in the format specified in section 4.1 of [inter_module_comm](../../../../Phase%201%20-%20Requirements%20Analysis%20%26%20Planning/inter_module_comm_gal_friday_v0.1.md)
- [ ] Check implementation of periodic reconciliation with exchange balances per FR-706
- [ ] Ensure drawdown calculations (daily, weekly, total) are correctly implemented

### B. Error Handling & Robustness

- [ ] Check for proper handling of invalid execution reports
- [ ] Verify error handling during reconciliation with exchange
- [ ] Ensure that calculation errors don't corrupt the portfolio state
- [ ] Check handling of edge cases (e.g., multiple fills, partial fills, order cancellations)
- [ ] Verify proper handling of fees and commissions in P&L calculations
- [ ] Ensure appropriate error recovery mechanisms
- [ ] Check that errors are logged with appropriate context for debugging

### C. asyncio Usage

- [ ] Verify correct usage of asyncio patterns for event handling
- [ ] Ensure that the `get_current_state` method provides synchronous access without blocking issues
- [ ] Check proper management of periodic reconciliation tasks
- [ ] Verify proper handling of CancelledError during shutdown
- [ ] Ensure proper resource cleanup during the stop method

### D. Dependencies & Imports

- [ ] Verify that imports are well-organized according to project standards
- [ ] Check for appropriate use of Decimal for financial calculations
- [ ] Ensure proper import and usage of the event bus/subscription mechanism
- [ ] Verify proper use of typing imports for type hinting
- [ ] Check that dependencies are used efficiently and appropriately

### E. Configuration & Hardcoding

- [ ] Verify that reconciliation frequency is configurable
- [ ] Check that initial state loading parameters are configurable
- [ ] Ensure that timestamp formats and timezone handling are configurable
- [ ] Verify that no account-specific values are hardcoded
- [ ] Check that drawdown calculation parameters (reset times for daily/weekly) are configurable

### F. Logging

- [ ] Verify appropriate logging of portfolio state updates
- [ ] Ensure logging of significant P&L events
- [ ] Check for logging of drawdown metrics
- [ ] Verify logging of reconciliation activities and discrepancies
- [ ] Ensure proper log level usage (info for normal operations, warning/error for issues)

### G. Readability & Style

- [ ] Verify clear, descriptive method and variable names
- [ ] Check for well-structured code organization
- [ ] Ensure complex financial calculations are well-commented
- [ ] Verify reasonable method length and complexity
- [ ] Check for helpful comments explaining portfolio state management

### H. Resource Management

- [ ] Verify efficient management of portfolio state data structures
- [ ] Check for proper handling of historical state for drawdown calculations
- [ ] Ensure background tasks for reconciliation are properly managed
- [ ] Verify that memory usage is bounded and appropriate
- [ ] Check for potential resource leaks in long-running operations

### I. Docstrings & Type Hinting

- [ ] Ensure comprehensive docstrings for the class and all methods
- [ ] Verify accurate type hints for method parameters and return values
- [ ] Check that financial calculations are well-documented
- [ ] Ensure portfolio state structures are well-documented
- [ ] Verify that public methods have complete parameter and return value documentation

### J. Financial Considerations

- [ ] Verify that financial calculations use Decimal to prevent floating-point errors
- [ ] Check that P&L calculations account for all factors (entry price, exit price, fees, etc.)
- [ ] Ensure drawdown calculations use appropriate reference points and time periods
- [ ] Verify proper handling of currency precision and rounding
- [ ] Check that equity calculations include mark-to-market for open positions
- [ ] Ensure proper handling of different asset types and trading pairs
- [ ] Verify correct implementation of exchange-specific accounting rules (e.g., fee structures)

### K. Concurrency & Thread Safety

- [ ] Verify that the portfolio state remains consistent during updates
- [ ] Check that the `get_current_state` method always returns a consistent snapshot
- [ ] Ensure that multiple concurrent updates are handled correctly
- [ ] Verify that state updates are atomic where necessary
- [ ] Check for race conditions in portfolio calculations

### L. Performance Considerations

- [ ] Verify that portfolio updates are processed efficiently
- [ ] Ensure that the `get_current_state` method is optimized for frequent calls
- [ ] Check that reconciliation doesn't impact system performance
- [ ] Verify that the module can handle the expected frequency of execution reports
- [ ] Ensure that historical state storage doesn't lead to excessive memory growth

## Improvement Suggestions

- [ ] Consider implementing a more detailed position tracking system (entry lots, etc.)
- [ ] Evaluate adding persistence for portfolio state for recovery after restarts
- [ ] Consider implementing a more sophisticated reconciliation mechanism
- [ ] Evaluate adding real-time performance metrics (Sharpe, Sortino, etc.)
- [ ] Consider implementing position cost basis rebalancing for partial fills/exits
- [ ] Assess adding portfolio visualization capabilities
- [ ] Consider implementing tax calculation helpers
- [ ] Evaluate adding support for multi-currency portfolios
