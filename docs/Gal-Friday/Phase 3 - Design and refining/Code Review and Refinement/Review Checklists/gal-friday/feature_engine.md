# Feature Engine Module Code Review Checklist

## Module Overview
The `feature_engine.py` module is responsible for consuming market data events (L2 order book and OHLCV), calculating technical indicators and order book features, and publishing feature events for downstream consumption. It handles:
- Processing incoming market data events from the DataIngestor
- Maintaining necessary data structures for feature calculation (price series, order book state)
- Calculating technical indicators (RSI, momentum, etc.) and order book metrics
- Publishing standardized feature vectors to the PredictionService

## Module Importance
This module is **highly important** as it transforms raw market data into the structured features required by the prediction models. The quality and correctness of these features directly impact the accuracy of trading signals and system performance.

## Architectural Context
According to the [architecture_concept](../../../../Phase%201%20-%20Requirements%20Analysis%20%26%20Planning/architecture_concept_gal_friday_v0.1.md), the `FeatureEngine` is the second module in the data processing pipeline, receiving market data events from the `DataIngestor` and producing feature events for the `PredictionService`.

## Review Checklist

- [ ] Check that feature calculation thresholds or constants are configurable, not hardcoded
- [ ] Ensure that the set of calculated features is configurable
- [ ] Verify that calculation frequencies or triggers are configurable
- [ ] Check that any numerical precision settings are configurable

### F. Logging

- [ ] Verify appropriate logging of feature calculation activities
- [ ] Ensure calculation errors or warnings are logged with context
- [ ] Check for logging of significant feature values (extreme readings)
- [ ] Verify that log levels are appropriate (info for normal operations, warning/error for issues)
- [ ] Ensure logging doesn't impact performance of time-critical calculations

### G. Readability & Style

- [ ] Verify clear, descriptive method and variable names
- [ ] Check for well-structured code organization, especially for different feature categories
- [ ] Ensure complex calculation logic is well-commented with formula references
- [ ] Verify reasonable method length and complexity
- [ ] Check for helpful comments explaining the purpose and interpretation of features

### H. Resource Management

- [ ] Verify efficient management of data structures (e.g., fixed-size circular buffers for price history)
- [ ] Check that memory usage is bounded and appropriate for the feature calculation needs
- [ ] Ensure any background tasks are properly tracked and cancelled on shutdown
- [ ] Verify that data structures are properly initialized and cleaned up
- [ ] Check for potential memory leaks in long-running calculations

### I. Docstrings & Type Hinting

- [ ] Ensure comprehensive docstrings for the class and all methods
- [ ] Verify accurate type hints for method parameters and return values
- [ ] Check that feature calculation methods clearly document their algorithms
- [ ] Ensure feature structures and types are well-documented
- [ ] Verify that public methods have complete parameter and return value documentation

### J. Feature-Specific Considerations

- [ ] Verify that OHLCV data is correctly handled for technical indicators
- [ ] Check that order book state is properly maintained for L2 features
- [ ] Ensure feature calculations are invoked at appropriate times (e.g., on each market update or periodically)
- [ ] Verify correct handling of timeframes for different features
- [ ] Check that features are consistently formatted before publishing
- [ ] Ensure that feature values have appropriate precision for downstream models
- [ ] Verify efficient recalculation strategy (incremental updates vs. full recalculation)

### K. Performance Considerations

- [ ] Verify that CPU-intensive calculations are optimized or potentially offloaded
- [ ] Check for efficient data structure usage in feature calculations
- [ ] Ensure that the calculation frequency matches the needs of the trading strategy
