# Data Ingestor Module Code Review Checklist

## Module Overview
The `data_ingestor.py` module is responsible for establishing and maintaining connections to the Kraken WebSocket API, subscribing to market data feeds, parsing incoming messages, and publishing standardized market data events internally. It handles:
- WebSocket connection establishment and management
- Market data feed subscriptions (L2 order book, OHLCV)
- Message parsing and normalization
- Internal event publishing for downstream processing
- Connection error handling and recovery

## Module Importance
This module is **critically important** as it serves as the primary data input gateway for the entire trading system. Any issues with data accuracy, timeliness, or completeness at this stage will propagate throughout the system and potentially lead to incorrect trading decisions.

## Architectural Context
According to the [architecture_concept](../../../../Phase%201%20-%20Requirements%20Analysis%20%26%20Planning/architecture_concept_gal_friday_v0.1.md), the `DataIngestor` is the first module in the data processing pipeline. It receives external market data and publishes standardized events that flow through the system's event-driven architecture.

## Review Checklist

### A. Correctness & Logic

- [ ] Verify that the implementation conforms to the `DataIngestor` interface defined in section 2.1 of the [interface_definitions](../../../../Phase%201%20-%20Requirements%20Analysis%20%26%20Planning/interface_definitions_gal_friday_v0.1.md) document
- [ ] Check that WebSocket connections are properly established with the Kraken API
- [ ] Verify correct subscription to required data feeds (L2 order book and OHLCV at 1-minute intervals) for configured trading pairs (XRP/USD, DOGE/USD) as specified in FR-102 of the [SRS](../../../../Phase%201%20-%20Requirements%20Analysis%20%26%20Planning/srs_gal_friday_v0.1.md)
- [ ] Ensure proper message parsing logic for different message types (subscription confirmations, heartbeats, data updates)
- [ ] Check that L2 order book state is correctly maintained with updates as required by FR-104
- [ ] Verify that the internal event publishing mechanism correctly formats and publishes market data events according to section 3.1 and 3.2 of the [inter_module_comm](../../../../Phase%201%20-%20Requirements%20Analysis%20%26%20Planning/inter_module_comm_gal_friday_v0.1.md) document
- [ ] Ensure that all required metadata fields are included in published events

### B. Error Handling & Robustness

- [ ] Verify implementation of reconnection strategy with exponential backoff as specified in FR-105
- [ ] Check proper handling of WebSocket disconnections, timeouts, and connection errors
- [ ] Ensure proper handling of malformed messages or unexpected response formats
- [ ] Verify detection and handling of data integrity issues (sequence gaps, checksum failures) as per FR-108
- [ ] Check that reconnection attempts are limited to avoid excessive resource usage
- [ ] Ensure missing data scenarios are handled appropriately (logging, potentially interpolating)
- [ ] Verify that critical errors trigger appropriate system alerts or monitoring events

### C. asyncio Usage

- [ ] Verify correct usage of asyncio for WebSocket connections (e.g., using libraries like websockets or aiohttp)
- [ ] Check for proper task management for the connection and message processing loops
- [ ] Ensure connection timeout handling uses asyncio patterns correctly
- [ ] Verify proper handling of asyncio.CancelledError during shutdown
- [ ] Check that the main processing loop doesn't block the event loop
- [ ] Ensure proper task cleanup during the stop method

### D. Dependencies & Imports

- [ ] Verify that imports are well-organized according to project standards
- [ ] Check for appropriate WebSocket client library usage (e.g., websockets, aiohttp)
- [ ] Ensure proper import and usage of the event bus/publication mechanism
- [ ] Verify proper use of typing imports for type hinting
- [ ] Check that dependencies are used efficiently and appropriately

### E. Configuration & Hardcoding

- [ ] Verify that WebSocket endpoints are configurable, not hardcoded
- [ ] Check that trading pairs are loaded from configuration, not hardcoded
- [ ] Ensure subscription parameters are configurable
- [ ] Verify that reconnection parameters (timeouts, backoff factors) are configurable
- [ ] Check that any data conversion or normalization logic uses configurable parameters where appropriate

### F. Logging

- [ ] Verify appropriate logging of connection events (connect, disconnect, reconnect attempts)
- [ ] Ensure subscription confirmations and rejections are logged
- [ ] Check for logging of any data integrity issues or parsing errors
- [ ] Verify that WebSocket errors are logged with sufficient context for debugging
- [ ] Ensure proper log level usage (info for normal operations, warning/error for issues)
- [ ] Check that excessive similar log entries are prevented during error conditions

### G. Readability & Style

- [ ] Verify clear, descriptive method and variable names
- [ ] Check for well-structured code organization
- [ ] Ensure complex WebSocket message handling logic is well-commented
- [ ] Verify reasonable method length and complexity
- [ ] Check for helpful comments explaining exchange-specific message formats or behaviors

### H. Resource Management

- [ ] Verify proper management of WebSocket connections
- [ ] Check for appropriate cleanup during disconnect/reconnect cycles
- [ ] Ensure memory usage is managed appropriately, especially for order book state
- [ ] Verify that any background tasks are properly tracked and cancelled on shutdown
- [ ] Check for potential resource leaks in error handling paths

### I. Docstrings & Type Hinting

- [ ] Ensure comprehensive docstrings for the class and all methods
- [ ] Verify accurate type hints for WebSocket message handling
- [ ] Check that complex message structures are well-documented
- [ ] Ensure event publishing methods have clear type hints
- [ ] Verify that public methods have complete parameter and return value documentation

### J. Market Data-Specific Considerations

- [ ] Verify correct handling of order book snapshots vs. incremental updates
- [ ] Check proper maintenance of the order book state (adds, updates, deletes)
- [ ] Ensure OHLCV data is correctly parsed and formatted
- [ ] Verify correct timestamp handling and conversion to ISO 8601 format
- [ ] Check that price and volume values maintain appropriate precision
- [ ] Ensure bid/ask sorting is maintained correctly (highest bid first, lowest ask first)
- [ ] Verify that the market data events contain all required fields as specified in the [inter_module_comm](../../../../Phase%201%20-%20Requirements%20Analysis%20%26%20Planning/inter_module_comm_gal_friday_v0.1.md) document

### K. Testing Considerations

- [ ] Check if the module is designed to be testable with mock WebSocket data
- [ ] Verify that connection management can be tested independently
- [ ] Ensure error scenarios can be simulated for testing
- [ ] Check that message parsing logic can be unit tested with sample messages

## Improvement Suggestions

- [ ] Consider implementing message rate monitoring to detect abnormal conditions
- [ ] Evaluate adding heartbeat monitoring for early detection of connection issues
- [ ] Consider implementing a circuit breaker for repeated connection failures
- [ ] Evaluate adding support for additional market data types for future expansion
- [ ] Consider implementing local data caching for recovery during brief disconnections
- [ ] Assess adding telemetry for connection quality and latency metrics
- [ ] Consider implementing a more sophisticated order book validation mechanism
- [ ] Evaluate adding support for trade data in addition to L2 and OHLCV
