# Main Module Code Review Checklist

## Module Overview
The `main.py` module serves as the entry point for the Gal-Friday trading system. It is responsible for:
- Parsing command-line arguments and initializing the system
- Coordinating the startup and shutdown of all core modules
- Managing the system lifecycle (initialization, running, graceful shutdown)
- Handling signals (e.g., SIGINT, SIGTERM) for clean shutdown
- Setting up the asyncio event loop and managing core tasks
- Providing the primary execution path for live trading, backtesting, and paper trading modes

## Module Importance
This module is **critically important** as it coordinates the entire system's operation. It ensures proper initialization order, dependency management, and graceful shutdown procedures, serving as the glue that connects all components.

## Architectural Context
While not explicitly defined as a separate component in the [architecture_concept](../../../../Phase%201%20-%20Requirements%20Analysis%20%26%20Planning/architecture_concept_gal_friday_v0.1.md), the main module is the orchestrator of the Modular Monolith architecture. It initializes all core modules defined in the architecture document and manages their relationships and lifecycle.

## Review Checklist

### A. Correctness & Logic

- [ ] Verify that the module correctly parses command-line arguments and initializes the appropriate mode (live, paper, backtest)

### B. Error Handling & Robustness

- [ ] Check for proper error handling during module initialization failures

- [ ] Check that configuration file path is configurable
- [ ] Ensure that core system settings are loaded from config, not hardcoded
- [ ] Verify that debug/verbose output flags are configurable
- [ ] Check for appropriate default values for unconfigured parameters
- [ ] Ensure that environment-specific behavior is configurable
- [ ] Verify that no sensitive information is hardcoded in the main module

### F. Logging

- [ ] Verify appropriate initialization of the logging system early in startup
- [ ] Check for proper logging of system startup with version information
- [ ] Ensure detailed logging of initialization sequence with timing information
- [ ] Verify logging of system mode and key configuration parameters
- [ ] Check for appropriate logging during shutdown sequence
- [ ] Ensure proper handling of logging during error conditions
- [ ] Verify that system exit status and reason are logged

### G. Readability & Style

- [ ] Verify clear, descriptive function and variable names
- [ ] Check for well-structured code organization with logical flow
- [ ] Ensure that the main execution path is clearly defined and easy to follow
- [ ] Verify reasonable function length and complexity
- [ ] Check for helpful comments explaining critical system flow
- [ ] Ensure clean separation between different system modes (live, paper, backtest)
- [ ] Verify consistent code style throughout the module

### H. Resource Management

- [ ] Verify proper management of all created system resources
- [ ] Check for appropriate cleanup during shutdown to prevent resource leaks
- [ ] Ensure correct order of shutdown operations (reverse of initialization)
- [ ] Verify proper cleanup even in error cases
- [ ] Check that all asyncio tasks are properly tracked and cancelled during shutdown
- [ ] Ensure file handles and external connections are properly closed

### I. Docstrings & Type Hinting

- [ ] Ensure comprehensive docstrings for the module and all functions
- [ ] Verify accurate type hints for function parameters and return values
- [ ] Check that command-line options and arguments are well-documented
- [ ] Ensure that the overall system flow is documented for maintainability
- [ ] Verify that public functions have complete parameter and return value documentation

### J. Application-Specific Considerations

- [ ] Verify that the module implements all run modes specified in NFR-201 (live, backtest, paper)
- [ ] Check that the entry point function (`main()`) is properly defined and executable
- [ ] Ensure correct integration with the CLI service for runtime commands
- [ ] Verify that system mode transitions (if applicable) are handled correctly
- [ ] Check for appropriate handling of long-running operation requirements
- [ ] Ensure the module adheres to the specified architecture and design patterns
- [ ] Verify that the main module doesn't contain trading logic that belongs in other modules

### K. Performance Considerations

- [ ] Verify efficient system initialization to minimize startup time
- [ ] Check for any unnecessary operations in the main event loop
- [ ] Ensure that the main module doesn't become a bottleneck for system operations
- [ ] Verify resource usage is appropriate during normal operation
- [ ] Check for efficient shutdown procedures

### L. Testing Considerations

- [ ] Verify that the main module can be tested in isolation
- [ ] Check for support of headless/unattended operation for testing
- [ ] Ensure that different run modes can be tested independently
- [ ] Verify that error conditions can be simulated and tested
- [ ] Check for testing support utilities or hooks if applicable

## Improvement Suggestions

- [ ] Consider implementing a more sophisticated plugin or module loading system
- [ ] Evaluate adding system status monitoring and health check capabilities
- [ ] Consider implementing module hot-reload capabilities for development
- [ ] Evaluate adding better system state visualization during startup/shutdown
- [ ] Consider implementing application state persistence for recovery after restart
- [ ] Assess adding more detailed performance profiling during execution
- [ ] Consider implementing a more sophisticated command-line interface for system control
