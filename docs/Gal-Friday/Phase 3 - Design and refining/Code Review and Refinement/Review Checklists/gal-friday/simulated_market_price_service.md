# Simulated Market Price Service Module Code Review Checklist

## Module Overview
The `simulated_market_price_service.py` module implements a simulated version of the Market Price Service for backtesting and paper trading. It handles:
- Providing simulated market pricing data based on historical or synthetic data
- Maintaining consistent interface compatibility with the real Market Price Service
- Simulating realistic market behavior including bid/ask spreads
- Supporting time-based progression of simulated prices
- Potentially implementing realistic market simulation features like slippage and liquidity constraints

## Module Importance
This module is **highly important** for backtesting and simulation capabilities of the system. It provides the foundation for realistic strategy testing by simulating market conditions without risking real capital.

## Architectural Context
The `SimulatedMarketPriceService` provides the same interface as the real `MarketPriceService` but is used during backtesting or paper trading modes as referenced in FR-1003 and FR-1007 of the [SRS](../../../../Phase%201%20-%20Requirements%20Analysis%20%26%20Planning/srs_gal_friday_v0.1.md). It is a critical component for the `BacktestingEngine` defined in section 2.10 of the [interface_definitions](../../../../Phase%201%20-%20Requirements%20Analysis%20%26%20Planning/interface_definitions_gal_friday_v0.1.md) document.
