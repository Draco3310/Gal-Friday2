# Backtesting Engine Module Code Review Checklist

## Module Overview
The `backtesting_engine.py` module implements the system's backtesting capabilities, allowing strategies to be tested against historical market data. It handles:
- Loading and processing historical OHLCV data
- Simulating market environment through time
- Orchestrating the interaction between core system modules in simulation mode
- Tracking trade execution and portfolio performance
- Calculating and reporting performance metrics

## Module Importance
This module is **highly important** for risk management and strategy validation. It allows testing of strategies before commitment of real capital.

## Review Checklist

### A. Correctness & Logic

- [ ] Verify that the implementation aligns with the `BacktestingEngine` interface defined in section 2.10 of [interface_definitions](../../../../Phase%201%20-%20Requirements%20Analysis%20%26%20Planning/interface_definitions_gal_friday_v0.1.md)
- [ ] Check that the historical data loading and processing logic correctly handles different formats and edge cases
- [ ] Ensure that the simulation event loop correctly replays market data events in chronological order
- [ ] Verify that the portfolio and P&L tracking logic accurately reflects the trading strategy's performance
- [ ] Check that performance metrics calculations use correct formulas (Sharpe ratio, drawdown, win rate, etc.)
- [ ] Validate that slippage and commission models reasonably approximate real-world conditions
- [ ] Ensure the module correctly manages the lifecycle of simulated services (initialization, start, stop)
- [ ] Verify that the module aligns with the backtesting design documentation in [backtester_design](../../../../Phase%201%20-%20Requirements%20Analysis%20%26%20Planning/backtester_design_gal_friday_v0.1.md)

### B. Error Handling & Robustness

- [ ] Check for appropriate error handling during historical data loading (missing files, malformed data)
- [ ] Verify graceful handling of data anomalies (missing timestamps, NaN values, outliers)
- [ ] Ensure robustness against varied market conditions (gaps, extreme volatility, flat periods)
- [ ] Check for proper exception handling in the simulation loop
- [ ] Validate proper cleanup of resources even after exceptions
- [ ] Check handling of empty or insufficient historical data scenarios
- [ ] Ensure proper error propagation to the caller with meaningful messages

### C. asyncio Usage

- [ ] Verify correct usage of asyncio primitives in the simulation loop
- [ ] Check that stopping services properly handles task cancellation
- [ ] Ensure the main simulation loop doesn't block the event loop
- [ ] Validate that event publishing uses proper awaitable patterns
- [ ] Check for appropriate handling of CancelledError exceptions
- [ ] Verify that service initialization and cleanup use correct async patterns

### D. Dependencies & Imports

- [ ] Verify that imports are well-organized and follow the project standard
- [ ] Check for appropriate fallback mechanisms when optional dependencies are missing
- [ ] Ensure no circular dependencies exist that could cause import issues
- [ ] Validate TYPE_CHECKING blocks are used correctly for type hints
- [ ] Check that the placeholder class creation mechanism works correctly for missing modules

### E. Configuration & Hardcoding

- [ ] Verify that backtesting parameters are configurable via the ConfigManager
- [ ] Check for hardcoded values that should be configurable (paths, thresholds, simulation parameters)
- [ ] Ensure sensible defaults for unconfigured parameters
- [ ] Verify that configuration validation is thorough before starting a backtest run
- [ ] Check that output paths and formats are configurable

### F. Logging

- [ ] Ensure appropriate logging of backtest progress and key events
- [ ] Verify that errors and warnings are logged with appropriate severity
- [ ] Check that logging provides sufficient context for debugging
- [ ] Validate that log verbosity is appropriate and configurable
- [ ] Ensure that sensitive information is not excessively logged

### G. Readability & Style

- [ ] Check method and variable names for clarity and consistency
- [ ] Verify that complex algorithms have sufficient comments explaining their purpose
- [ ] Ensure methods are reasonably sized and follow single responsibility principle
- [ ] Check that the code flow is logical and easy to follow
- [ ] Validate that helper methods are used to break down complex processes

### H. Resource Management

- [ ] Verify proper management of the ProcessPoolExecutor
- [ ] Check for potential memory leaks during long simulation runs
- [ ] Ensure proper cleanup of services and resources when a backtest completes or fails
- [ ] Validate that file handles are properly closed after reading historical data
- [ ] Check for resource-intensive operations that might need optimization

### I. Docstrings & Type Hinting

- [ ] Ensure comprehensive docstrings for the class and all public methods
- [ ] Verify accurate type hints throughout the code
- [ ] Check for proper return type annotations
- [ ] Validate that complex parameter types are well-documented
- [ ] Ensure docstrings explain parameters, return values, and potential exceptions

### J. Backtesting Specific Considerations

- [ ] Verify that the simulation accurately replicates the event flow of the live system
- [ ] Check that trade execution simulation properly models fills, slippage, and rejections
- [ ] Ensure performance metrics align with industry standards
- [ ] Validate that the equity curve and trade log capture all necessary information
- [ ] Check that results saving/reporting provides sufficient detail for analysis
- [ ] Verify that different market scenarios can be properly simulated
- [ ] Ensure the simulation speed is optimized for reasonable runtime with large datasets

### K. Testing Considerations

- [ ] Check if the module itself is testable with unit/integration tests
- [ ] Verify that edge cases are covered in tests (empty data, extreme markets)
- [ ] Ensure different trading strategies can be effectively tested
- [ ] Validate that backtesting results can be compared against known benchmarks

## Improvement Suggestions

- [ ] Consider adding visualization capabilities for equity curves and drawdowns
- [ ] Evaluate adding Monte Carlo simulation for more robust strategy evaluation
- [ ] Consider implementing parallel backtesting for multiple parameter combinations
- [ ] Assess adding detailed trade and portfolio state export for external analysis
- [ ] Evaluate implementing walk-forward testing capabilities
- [ ] Consider adding benchmark comparison features (vs. buy-and-hold, etc.)
- [ ] Assess adding support for multi-asset portfolio backtesting
