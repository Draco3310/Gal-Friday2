# Monitoring Service Module Code Review Checklist

## Module Overview
The `monitoring_service.py` module is responsible for monitoring system health, checking for HALT conditions, and managing overall system state. It handles:
- Monitoring critical system components and services
- Detecting data freshness issues and API connectivity problems
- Receiving and processing potential HALT triggers
- Implementing system HALT and resume functionality
- Publishing system state change events
- Providing system state information to other modules

## Module Importance
This module is **critically important** as it serves as the safety circuit breaker for the entire trading system. It ensures that trading stops when unsafe conditions are detected, protecting against excessive losses or erratic behavior.

## Architectural Context
According to the [architecture_concept](../../../../Phase%201%20-%20Requirements%20Analysis%20%26%20Planning/architecture_concept_gal_friday_v0.1.md), the `MonitoringService` interacts with multiple modules, receiving potential HALT triggers (especially from the `RiskManager`), and publishes system state change events. The `ExecutionHandler` checks with the `MonitoringService` before executing new trades to ensure the system is not in a HALT state.

## Review Checklist
