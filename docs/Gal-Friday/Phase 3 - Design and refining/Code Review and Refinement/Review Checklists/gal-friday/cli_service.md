# CLI Service Module Code Review Checklist

## Module Overview
The `cli_service.py` module implements the command-line interface for user interaction with the Gal-Friday trading system. It is responsible for:
- Parsing command-line arguments (mode, config path)
- Processing runtime commands from the user (status, stop, halt, resume)
- Providing a text-based interface for monitoring and controlling the trading system
- Initiating system state changes through interaction with the MonitoringService

## Module Importance
This module is **important** as it provides the primary user interface for the Administrator/Monitor role to control and interact with the Gal-Friday trading system. It is the main entry point for system operation and emergency intervention.

## Architectural Context
According to the [architecture_concept](../../../../Phase%201%20-%20Requirements%20Analysis%20%26%20Planning/architecture_concept_gal_friday_v0.1.md), the `CLIService` acts as the user-facing component for system control. It interacts directly with the `MonitoringService` to trigger HALT/Resume conditions and with the main application controller to manage the system lifecycle.

## Review Checklist

### A. Correctness & Logic

- [ ] Verify that the implementation conforms to the `CLIService` interface defined in section 2.12 of the [interface_definitions](../../../../Phase%201%20-%20Requirements%20Analysis%20%26%20Planning/interface_definitions_gal_friday_v0.1.md) document
- [ ] Check that command-line argument parsing correctly handles the specified options (run mode: live/backtest/paper, config file path) as per NFR-201 in the [SRS](../../../../Phase%201%20-%20Requirements%20Analysis%20%26%20Planning/srs_gal_friday_v0.1.md)
- [ ] Verify that runtime commands ('status', 'stop', 'halt', 'resume') are properly implemented and handled
- [ ] Ensure the service correctly interacts with the `MonitoringService` to trigger system HALT and Resume operations
- [ ] Check that the service provides appropriate status information to the user when requested
- [ ] Verify proper initialization of dependencies (e.g., config_manager, monitoring_service)
- [ ] Ensure the CLI loop doesn't block other system operations (should use async patterns if in main event loop)

### B. Error Handling & Robustness

- [ ] Check for proper handling of invalid command-line arguments with clear error messages
- [ ] Verify that runtime command errors are handled gracefully with informative feedback
- [ ] Ensure the CLI continues functioning after invalid commands
- [ ] Check for proper exception handling within command processing
- [ ] Verify that the CLI can detect and report system state (e.g., already halted, not running)
- [ ] Ensure that critical commands (halt, resume) have confirmation prompts or safeguards

### C. asyncio Usage

- [ ] If the CLI runs in the main event loop, verify proper asyncio patterns for command input
- [ ] Check that long-running CLI operations don't block the event loop
- [ ] Ensure proper task management for any background CLI operations
- [ ] Verify that asyncio cancellation is handled appropriately
- [ ] Check for correct usage of asyncio primitives for any event-based command handling

### D. Dependencies & Imports

- [ ] Verify that imports are organized correctly and follow project standards
- [ ] Check for appropriate dependencies on the required modules (config_manager, monitoring_service)
- [ ] Ensure no circular dependencies exist
- [ ] Verify proper use of typing imports for type hinting

### E. Configuration & Hardcoding

- [ ] Check that configuration file paths can be specified via command-line arguments
- [ ] Ensure no hardcoded values that should be configurable
- [ ] Verify that help text and command descriptions are well-structured
- [ ] Check that CLI prompt formatting is configurable or follows consistent standards

### F. Logging

- [ ] Verify appropriate logging of CLI operations and commands
- [ ] Ensure user commands are logged with timestamps for audit purposes
- [ ] Check for logging of critical actions (halt, resume, shutdown)
- [ ] Verify that logging doesn't interfere with CLI output/display
- [ ] Ensure proper log level usage (info for normal operations, warning/error for issues)

### G. Readability & Style

- [ ] Verify clear, descriptive command and argument names
- [ ] Check for helpful command descriptions and help text
- [ ] Ensure consistent CLI prompting and feedback style
- [ ] Verify reasonable method length and complexity
- [ ] Check for helpful comments explaining CLI flow and command processing

### H. Resource Management

- [ ] Verify proper cleanup of resources on exit
- [ ] Check for management of any input/output streams
- [ ] Ensure the CLI doesn't consume excessive memory or CPU
- [ ] Verify that any background tasks are properly tracked and cancelled on shutdown

### I. Docstrings & Type Hinting

- [ ] Ensure comprehensive docstrings for the class and all methods
- [ ] Verify appropriate type hints for arguments and return values
- [ ] Check that complex command processing logic is well-documented
- [ ] Ensure argument descriptions in docstrings match actual behavior

### J. User Interface Considerations

- [ ] Verify that command feedback is clear and informative
- [ ] Check that status display presents relevant information in a readable format
- [ ] Ensure critical errors and warnings are prominently displayed
- [ ] Verify that the CLI meets the requirements specified in NFR-201 of the [SRS](../../../../Phase%201%20-%20Requirements%20Analysis%20%26%20Planning/srs_gal_friday_v0.1.md)
- [ ] Check that help/usage information is comprehensive and easily accessible
- [ ] Ensure the CLI provides appropriate feedback when system state changes
- [ ] Verify that long-running operations provide progress indication where applicable

### K. Security Considerations

- [ ] Check that sensitive information (API keys, full account details) is not displayed in CLI output
- [ ] Verify that critical commands (halt, stop) have appropriate authorization or confirmation
- [ ] Ensure CLI input is properly validated to prevent injection or other attacks
- [ ] Check that error messages don't reveal implementation details unnecessarily

## Improvement Suggestions

- [ ] Consider adding command history functionality for easier command reuse
- [ ] Evaluate adding command auto-completion for improved usability
- [ ] Consider implementing a more structured command system for future extensibility
- [ ] Evaluate adding color coding for different types of output (status, warnings, errors)
- [ ] Consider adding a "quiet" mode for script-based operation
- [ ] Assess adding more detailed system status reporting capabilities
- [ ] Consider implementing session logging for command history
- [ ] Evaluate adding support for command aliases or shortcuts for frequently used commands
