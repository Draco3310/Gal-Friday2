# Simulated Execution Handler Module Code Review Checklist

## Module Overview
The `simulated_execution_handler.py` module implements a simulated version of the Execution Handler for backtesting and paper trading. It handles:
- Simulating order placement, fills, and cancellations without actual exchange interaction
- Maintaining consistent interface compatibility with the real Execution Handler
- Simulating realistic market behavior including slippage, partial fills, and rejections
- Implementing realistic order matching logic against simulated order book data
- Publishing execution reports that reflect realistic trading conditions

## Module Importance
This module is **highly important** for the backtesting and paper trading capabilities of the system. It allows strategies to be tested with realistic execution simulation without risking real capital, providing essential feedback on strategy performance under various market conditions.

## Architectural Context
The `SimulatedExecutionHandler` provides the same interface as the real `ExecutionHandler` but is used during backtesting or paper trading modes as referenced in FR-1003 and FR-1007 of the [SRS](../../../../Phase%201%20-%20Requirements%20Analysis%20%26%20Planning/srs_gal_friday_v0.1.md). It works closely with the `SimulatedMarketPriceService` and is a critical component for the `BacktestingEngine` defined in section 2.10 of the [interface_definitions](../../../../Phase%201%20-%20Requirements%20Analysis%20%26%20Planning/interface_definitions_gal_friday_v0.1.md) document.
