# Core Events Module Code Review Checklist

## Module Overview
The `events.py` module defines the event data structures used throughout the system for inter-module communication. It contains:
- `EventType` enum that defines all possible event types
- Base `Event` class with common metadata
- Specific event dataclasses for various system events (market data, trade signals, system state changes, etc.)

## Module Importance
This module is **critical** to system operation as it defines the contract between all communicating modules. Issues here will propagate throughout the entire system. The events defined here form the backbone of the event-driven architecture specified in the [architecture_concept](../../../../Phase%201%20-%20Requirements%20Analysis%20%26%20Planning/architecture_concept_gal_friday_v0.1.md) document.

## Architectural Context
According to the [architecture_diagram](../../../../Phase%201%20-%20Requirements%20Analysis%20%26%20Planning/architecture_diagram_gal_friday_v0.1.mmd), all modules in the system communicate via events. The events defined in this module establish the standardized payloads for this communication, making it a foundational component of the Modular Monolith architecture.

## Review Checklist

### A. Correctness & Logic

- [ ] Verify that all event types defined in `EventType` enum match those specified in section 3 of the [inter_module_comm](../../../../Phase%201%20-%20Requirements%20Analysis%20%26%20Planning/inter_module_comm_gal_friday_v0.1.md) document (3.1-3.10)
- [ ] Check that fields in each event class align with the payload structures defined in section 3 of the [inter_module_comm](../../../../Phase%201%20-%20Requirements%20Analysis%20%26%20Planning/inter_module_comm_gal_friday_v0.1.md) document
- [ ] Ensure that dataclasses are correctly marked as `frozen=True` to maintain immutability as required for event consistency
- [ ] Validate that proper initialization is enforced for all required fields per event type specifications
- [ ] Verify correct usage of default field values using `field(default=..., init=False)` for event_type fields
- [ ] Check for consistency in type handling of numeric values (Decimal vs float vs string) according to section 3 of [inter_module_comm](../../../../Phase%201%20-%20Requirements%20Analysis%20%26%20Planning/inter_module_comm_gal_friday_v0.1.md)
- [ ] Ensure that `uuid` generation is handled appropriately in event instantiation to guarantee unique event tracking

### B. Error Handling & Robustness

- [ ] Check if validation is needed for critical field values at instantiation (especially for financial values)
- [ ] Consider if any events need additional validation methods to ensure data integrity
- [ ] If conversion from strings to Decimal is performed anywhere, ensure proper error handling to prevent runtime errors
- [ ] Verify the immutability design prevents modification of events after creation, maintaining system integrity

### C. asyncio Usage

- [ ] Not applicable for this module (pure data structures)
- [ ] Verify that the event structures support efficient async processing as outlined in section 4 of [architecture_concept](../../../../Phase%201%20-%20Requirements%20Analysis%20%26%20Planning/architecture_concept_gal_friday_v0.1.md)

### D. Dependencies & Imports

- [ ] Verify imports are well-organized (stdlib first, then third-party, then application)
- [ ] Check for unnecessary imports that could add overhead
- [ ] Ensure no circular dependencies exist with other modules
- [ ] Validate proper usage of `typing` imports for clear type definitions
- [ ] Confirm any financial/numeric type imports (e.g., Decimal) are used appropriately for trading operations

### E. Configuration & Hardcoding

- [ ] Check if any event field names, event types, or enum values should be sourced from configuration rather than hardcoded
- [ ] Verify that no magic strings or constants are embedded in the event classes
- [ ] Ensure all constant values match those specified in the [interface_definitions](../../../../Phase%201%20-%20Requirements%20Analysis%20%26%20Planning/interface_definitions_gal_friday_v0.1.md) document

### F. Logging

- [ ] Not directly applicable (dataclasses only)
- [ ] Check if `LogEvent` structure matches requirements in section 3.9 of [inter_module_comm](../../../../Phase%201%20-%20Requirements%20Analysis%20%26%20Planning/inter_module_comm_gal_friday_v0.1.md)

### G. Readability & Style

- [ ] Ensure all classes and enum values have clear, descriptive docstrings
- [ ] Verify logical grouping of event classes (system events, market data events, etc.) as per the event categorization in the [inter_module_comm](../../../../Phase%201%20-%20Requirements%20Analysis%20%26%20Planning/inter_module_comm_gal_friday_v0.1.md) document
- [ ] Check that field names are consistently named across related event classes
- [ ] Ensure comments are helpful and up-to-date (remove TODOs if implemented)
- [ ] Verify PEP 8 compliance for code style consistency

### H. Resource Management

- [ ] Not applicable for this module (no resources to manage)

### I. Docstrings & Type Hinting

- [ ] Ensure all classes have meaningful docstrings explaining their purpose
- [ ] Verify all fields have appropriate type hints that match the specifications in [inter_module_comm](../../../../Phase%201%20-%20Requirements%20Analysis%20%26%20Planning/inter_module_comm_gal_friday_v0.1.md)
- [ ] Check proper usage of Optional, List, Dict and other complex types
- [ ] Validate that type hints match the expected data flow between modules described in section 4 of [architecture_concept](../../../../Phase%201%20-%20Requirements%20Analysis%20%26%20Planning/architecture_concept_gal_friday_v0.1.md)

### J. Event Design Considerations

- [ ] Consider if any events have grown too large or complex and might need refactoring
- [ ] Verify that each event carries only the essential data needed by subscribers
- [ ] Check for any missing events based on the current system architecture requirements in [architecture_concept](../../../../Phase%201%20-%20Requirements%20Analysis%20%26%20Planning/architecture_concept_gal_friday_v0.1.md)
- [ ] Ensure events properly separate concerns (e.g., market data separate from trading signals) according to the module boundaries defined in section 3 of [architecture_concept](../../../../Phase%201%20-%20Requirements%20Analysis%20%26%20Planning/architecture_concept_gal_friday_v0.1.md)
- [ ] Verify the event structure facilitates the data flow described in section 4 of [architecture_concept](../../../../Phase%201%20-%20Requirements%20Analysis%20%26%20Planning/architecture_concept_gal_friday_v0.1.md)

### K. Data Integrity & Serialization

- [ ] Consider if events need methods for validation, conversion, or serialization for persistent storage
- [ ] Check handling of decimal precision for financial calculations (particularly critical for order amounts and prices)
- [ ] Verify timestamp handling and consistency across events
- [ ] Ensure proper definitions for exchange-specific data formats according to the Kraken API requirements
- [ ] Validate that numeric values for trading operations use Decimal where appropriate to prevent floating-point precision issues

### L. Trading-Specific Requirements

- [ ] Verify that market data events (L2, OHLCV) contain all fields needed for the trading strategies defined in section 3.4 of the [SRS](../../../../Phase%201%20-%20Requirements%20Analysis%20%26%20Planning/srs_gal_friday_v0.1.md)
- [ ] Ensure trade signal events contain all required fields for the risk management processes defined in section 3.5 of the [SRS](../../../../Phase%201%20-%20Requirements%20Analysis%20%26%20Planning/srs_gal_friday_v0.1.md)
- [ ] Check that execution events properly track all order states needed for portfolio management as per section 3.7 of the [SRS](../../../../Phase%201%20-%20Requirements%20Analysis%20%26%20Planning/srs_gal_friday_v0.1.md)

## Improvement Suggestions

- [ ] Consider adding factory methods for common event creation patterns to simplify instantiation
- [ ] Evaluate need for helper methods to convert between related event types
- [ ] Consider adding validation methods to complex event classes
- [ ] Assess if any events would benefit from additional metadata
- [ ] Evaluate if event creation utilities would help ensure proper UUID and timestamp assignment
- [ ] Consider adding methods to convert event data to formats suitable for logging or persistence
