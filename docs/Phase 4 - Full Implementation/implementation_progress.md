# Gal-Friday2 Implementation Progress

## Current Status (May 22, 2025)

The project is currently in the implementation phase. As of now, we have completed work through task 3.18 in the project plan, and are continuing with the full implementation as designed in the earlier phases.

## Recent Improvements

### Code Quality Infrastructure

We have established a comprehensive code quality infrastructure with the following components:

1. **Tooling Modernization**:
   - Consolidated linting and formatting with Ruff
   - Enhanced type checking with Mypy
   - Integrated security scanning with Bandit
   - Implemented pre-commit hooks for automated quality control

2. **Documentation**:
   - Updated testing documentation
   - Refreshed contributing guidelines
   - Created detailed code quality standards

3. **Configuration**:
   - Optimized pyproject.toml with clean, well-organized settings
   - Updated GitHub Actions workflows
   - Fixed duplicate configuration sections

## Current Focus Areas

1. **Code Quality**:
   - Addressing linting and type checking issues
   - Installing missing type stubs for dependencies
   - Improving docstring coverage and formatting

2. **Testing**:
   - Expanding test coverage
   - Implementing memory profiling for critical components
   - Ensuring all components have appropriate unit and integration tests

3. **Documentation**:
   - Keeping documentation in sync with implementation
   - Enhancing user and developer guides

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Remaining Implementation Tasks**:
   - Finish refining the backtesting engine
   - Complete any remaining core functionality

2. **Quality Assurance**:
   - Run comprehensive test suite with coverage analysis
   - Address identified issues and edge cases

3. **Integration**:
   - Ensure all modules work together seamlessly
   - Validate end-to-end workflows

4. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Identify and address performance bottlenecks
   - Optimize resource usage for critical components

5. **Documentation Finalization**:
