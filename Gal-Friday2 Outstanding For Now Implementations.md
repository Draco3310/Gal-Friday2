# **Gal-Friday2: Outstanding "For Now" Implementations**

This document tracks temporary or placeholder implementations within the Gal-Friday2 codebase, marked with "for now" comments. The goal is to provide a structured overview of these areas, their current limitations, and proposed next steps for full implementation. This will serve as a targeted list for future development and refactoring, potentially leveraging AI tools like Codex for assistance.

## **I. Core Module**

### **gal\_friday/core/asset\_registry.py**

* **Line:** 277,44  
* **Current Comment:** \# Future expansion examples (commented for now)  
* **Problem/Context:** The asset registry has commented-out sections indicating planned future expansion for handling different asset types or more complex registration logic. These are currently unimplemented placeholders.  
* **Proposed Next Steps:**  
  * **Identify Specific Needs:** Define concrete requirements for future asset types or registry functionalities.  
  * **Implement Fully:** Develop and integrate the commented-out or new features based on the identified needs.  
  * **Remove Comment:** Once implemented, remove the "for now" comment.

### **gal\_friday/core/event\_store.py**

* **Line:** 109,23  
* **Current Comment:** \# For now, let's attempt to get a default or raise  
* **Problem/Context:** This indicates a temporary error handling or default value retrieval strategy when an event is not found or cannot be processed as expected. It's a simplified approach that might not be robust.  
* **Proposed Next Steps:**  
  * **Refine Error Handling:** Implement a more specific and robust error handling mechanism (e.g., custom exceptions for different types of event store failures).  
  * **Define Default Behavior:** Clearly define and implement the intended default behavior if an event is not found, rather than a generic "attempt to get a default or raise."

## **II. Data Access Layer (DAL) & Migrations**

### **gal\_friday/dal/migrations/migration\_manager.py**

* **Line:** 39,15  
* **Current Comment:** \# For now, subsequent calls will likely fail if alembic\_cfg cannot be loaded.  
* **Problem/Context:** The current handling of alembic\_cfg loading is fragile. If the configuration cannot be loaded, subsequent migration operations might fail without proper error recovery.  
* **Proposed Next Steps:**  
  * **Robust Configuration Loading:** Implement comprehensive error handling and fallback mechanisms for alembic\_cfg loading. Ensure the system can gracefully handle missing or malformed configuration files.  
  * **Early Validation:** Add validation checks at the beginning of migration operations to ensure alembic\_cfg is successfully loaded before proceeding.  
* **Line:** 103,15  
* **Current Comment:** \# For now, let's try to get script heads which doesn't require DB connection.  
* **Problem/Context:** This implies a workaround to get Alembic script heads without a database connection, which might be necessary for certain CLI commands but could lead to inconsistencies if the script heads in the environment don't match the database state.  
* **Proposed Next Steps:**  
  * **Conditional DB Connection:** Determine scenarios where a DB connection is strictly necessary for migration operations and enforce it.  
  * **Clear Separation:** Explicitly separate "offline" migration operations (script analysis) from "online" operations (applying migrations).  
* **Line:** 112,15  
* **Current Comment:** \# For now, sticking to a method that can get DB state if possible.  
* **Problem/Context:** Similar to the above, this suggests a less-than-ideal method for retrieving the database state. It might be unreliable or inefficient.  
* **Proposed Next Steps:**  
  * **Standardize DB State Retrieval:** Implement a robust and consistent method for retrieving the database's current migration state, ensuring it's always accurate and handles various database connection scenarios.

### **gal\_friday/dal/models/position\_adjustment.py**

* **Line:** 23,167  
* **Current Comment:** reconciliation\_id: Mapped\[UUID | None\] \= mapped\_column( \# Schema in 001 allows NULL, 003 implies NOT NULL via REFERENCES. Assuming 001 version for FK nullability for now.  
* **Problem/Context:** There's an inconsistency between schema versions regarding the nullability of reconciliation\_id. The current code assumes an older schema (001) for foreign key nullability, which might break if a newer schema (003) with NOT NULL is applied.  
* **Proposed Next Steps:**  
  * **Align Schema Definitions:** Resolve the schema inconsistency. Either update the database schema to explicitly allow NULL or enforce NOT NULL and adjust the code to handle the presence of a reconciliation\_id consistently.  
  * **Add Migration:** If changing the schema, create a new Alembic migration to reflect the correct nullability.

### **gal\_friday/dal/repositories/experiment\_repository.py**

* **Line:** 67,15  
* **Current Comment:** \# For now, let's assume BaseRepository.create or a direct session.merge could work  
* **Problem/Context:** This indicates uncertainty or a lack of clarity in how new experiment records are persisted. Relying on assumptions can lead to subtle data integrity issues.  
* **Proposed Next Steps:**  
  * **Explicit Persistence Logic:** Clearly define and implement the exact SQLAlchemy operation (session.add, session.merge, etc.) for creating new Experiment records, considering all edge cases (e.g., existing records, detached objects).  
  * **Unit Tests:** Add specific unit tests to ensure experiment creation and updates behave as expected with the chosen persistence method.  
* **Line:** 134,15  
* **Current Comment:** \# For now, let's just return the input or fetch it.  
* **Problem/Context:** This suggests a simplified or incomplete implementation for retrieving experiment outcomes. It might not accurately reflect the stored data or handle various query parameters.  
* **Proposed Next Steps:**  
  * **Implement Robust Retrieval:** Develop proper query logic to fetch experiment outcomes from the database, handling different filtering, sorting, and pagination requirements.  
  * **Error Handling:** Ensure the method gracefully handles cases where no matching experiment outcomes are found.

### **gal\_friday/dal/alembic.ini**

* **Line:** 25,3  
* **Current Comment:** \# For now, "." is standard if CWD is project root.  
* **Problem/Context:** The alembic.ini file's path resolution (.) assumes the current working directory is always the project root, which might not be true in all deployment or development environments (e.g., when running scripts from subdirectories).  
* **Proposed Next Steps:**  
  * **Relative Path Configuration:** Use more robust path resolution in alembic.ini or ensure that scripts running Alembic explicitly set the working directory or provide the correct path to alembic.ini.  
  * **Environment Variables:** Consider using environment variables to specify the project root or Alembic configuration path.

## **III. Execution Module**

### **gal\_friday/execution/adapters.py**

* **Line:** 543,11  
* **Current Comment:** \# For now, place individually but could be enhanced with AddOrderBatch  
* **Problem/Context:** Orders are currently placed individually, which might be inefficient for high-frequency trading where batching orders could significantly reduce latency and API calls.  
* **Proposed Next Steps:**  
  * **Implement Batching:** Integrate with the exchange's AddOrderBatch functionality (if available) or implement a local batching mechanism to aggregate orders before sending them to the exchange API.  
  * **Performance Testing:** Measure the performance improvements after implementing batching.

### **gal\_friday/execution/order\_position\_integration.py**

* **Line:** 417,15  
* **Current Comment:** \# For now, just log that manual intervention is needed  
* **Problem/Context:** This indicates a critical state where an automated process fails and requires manual intervention. While logging is good, it's not a complete solution for a production system.  
* **Proposed Next Steps:**  
  * **Automated Recovery/Alerting:** Implement automated recovery strategies or robust alerting (e.g., email, PagerDuty) to notify operations teams immediately, providing all necessary context for manual intervention.  
  * **Define Manual Process:** Document the exact manual intervention steps required.  
* **Line:** 437,15  
* **Current Comment:** \# For now, placeholder implementation  
* **Problem/Context:** This suggests a function or method crucial for order-position integration is not fully implemented and currently has only basic or non-functional logic.  
* **Proposed Next Steps:**  
  * **Full Implementation:** Develop the complete logic for this placeholder, ensuring it adheres to business rules and integrates correctly with other components.  
  * **Comprehensive Testing:** Write unit and integration tests to validate the full implementation.

### **gal\_friday/execution/websocket\_client.py**

* **Line:** 709,15  
* **Current Comment:** \# For now, publish as execution report  
* **Problem/Context:** This implies that certain messages received via the WebSocket are currently generically published as "execution reports," even if they might represent different types of events (e.g., order updates, fill confirmations, cancellations). This could lead to a loss of granularity or incorrect event handling downstream.  
* **Proposed Next Steps:**  
  * **Granular Event Mapping:** Accurately parse WebSocket messages and map them to specific internal event types (e.g., OrderUpdateEvent, FillEvent, CancellationEvent).  
  * **Dedicated Event Publishing:** Publish these granular events to the appropriate PubSub topics, allowing downstream services to react precisely to each event type.

## **IV. Model Lifecycle & Prediction**

### **gal\_friday/model\_lifecycle/experiment\_manager.py**

* **Line:** 1019,81  
* **Current Comment:** \# Add to active experiments (still using ExperimentConfig dataclass for now)

* **Proposed Next Steps:**  
  * **Evaluate ExperimentConfig:** Review ExperimentConfig to determine if it meets all long-term requirements. If not, design a more robust model.  
  * **Migration:** If a new model is introduced, plan a migration strategy for existing data.  
* **Line:** 1405,19  
* **Current Comment:** \# For now, assume a basic mapping or that ExperimentConfig adapts.  
* **Problem/Context:** This implies a loose coupling or a simplified mapping between data structures related to experiments. This could lead to data inconsistencies or errors if the assumptions are violated.  
* **Proposed Next Steps:**  
  * **Explicit Data Mapping:** Implement explicit and robust data mapping logic between different experiment-related data structures.  
  * **Validation:** Add validation to ensure data consistency during mapping.

* **Line:** 54,26  
* **Current Comment:** \# Returning dict for now to satisfy type hint via forward reference  
* **Problem/Context:** A dictionary is being returned to satisfy type hints, likely as a temporary solution. This might bypass proper object serialization/deserialization or obscure the actual data structure.  
* **Proposed Next Steps:**  
  * **Proper Serialization:** Implement proper serialization/deserialization methods (e.g., to\_dict, from\_dict, Pydantic models) that return the actual intended object types rather than raw dictionaries.  
  * **Refactor Type Hints:** Update type hints to reflect the actual object types.

### **gal\_friday/models/order.py**

* **Line:** 103,26  
* **Current Comment:** \# Returning dict for now  
* **Problem/Context:** Similar to configuration.py, returning a dictionary for an Order object is a temporary measure that might hide structured data.  
* **Proposed Next Steps:**  
  * **Implement to\_dict or to\_json:** Provide a structured method to convert Order objects into a dictionary format if needed for specific use cases (e.g., API responses, logging), ensuring all relevant fields are included and properly typed.

### **gal\_friday/models/signal.py**

* **Line:** 78,26  
* **Current Comment:** \# Returning dict for now  
* **Problem/Context:** Similar to other models, returning a dictionary for a Signal object suggests an incomplete or simplified data representation.  
* **Proposed Next Steps:**  
  * **Implement to\_dict or to\_json:** Ensure Signal objects have a proper method for structured serialization to a dictionary, if required, maintaining data integrity and clarity.

### **gal\_friday/models/trade.py**

* **Line:** 99,26  
* **Current Comment:** \# Returning dict for now  
* **Problem/Context:** Similar to other models, returning a dictionary for a Trade object suggests an incomplete or simplified data representation.

* **Proposed Next Steps:**  
  * **Refine Calculation Logic:** Expand the calculation to include other relevant factors (e.g., volatility, market liquidity, correlations) to provide a more accurate and holistic view.  
  * **External Library Integration:** Consider integrating a specialized financial analytics library for advanced risk metrics.  
* **Line:** 441,7  
* **Current Comment:** \# For now, return mock data  
* **Problem/Context:** The dashboard backend is currently returning mock data, meaning it's not yet connected to real-time or historical data sources.  
* **Proposed Next Steps:**  
  * **Integrate with Data Sources:** Connect the backend to the actual data repositories (e.g., database, InfluxDB) to fetch live or historical performance metrics.  
  * **Remove Mock Data:** Delete the mock data generation once real data integration is complete.

### **gal\_friday/monitoring/position\_order\_data\_quality.py**

* **Line:** 347,15  
* **Current Comment:** \# For now, placeholder for future enhancement  
* **Problem/Context:** A specific data quality check or enhancement related to position and order data is currently a placeholder, indicating a missing crucial validation or processing step.  
* **Proposed Next Steps:**  
  * **Define Data Quality Rules:** Clearly define the data quality rules and metrics for position and order data (e.g., consistency, completeness, timeliness).  
  * **Implement Validation Logic:** Develop the full implementation of the data quality checks and integrate them into the monitoring pipeline.

### **gal\_friday/monitoring\_service.py**

* **Line:** 1286,15  
* **Current Comment:** \# For now, just log the notification  
* **Problem/Context:** Alerts or important notifications are only being logged, which is insufficient for critical events in a trading system.  
* **Proposed Next Steps:**  
  * **Implement Robust Alerting:** Integrate with external alerting systems (e.g., PagerDuty, Slack, email) for critical notifications, ensuring high-priority alerts are delivered reliably.  
  * **Configurable Alerting:** Allow configuration of alert thresholds and delivery channels.  
* **Line:** 2734,15  
* **Current Comment:** \# For now, assuming it's sync as requested for MVP.  
* **Problem/Context:** A process or operation is currently implemented synchronously, which might block the main thread and hinder performance, especially in a high-frequency system. This was likely a decision for MVP.  
* **Proposed Next Steps:**  
  * **Asynchronous Implementation:** Refactor the operation to be asynchronous (e.g., using asyncio, Celery, or a dedicated message queue) to prevent blocking and improve scalability.  
  * **Performance Benchmarking:** Benchmark synchronous vs. asynchronous performance to validate the improvement.  
* **Line:** 3136,15  
* **Current Comment:** \# For now, simulating the call  
* **Problem/Context:** A critical function call (possibly to an external service or a complex internal component) is currently simulated, meaning its actual integration is pending.  
* **Proposed Next Steps:**  
  * **Replace Simulation with Actual Call:** Integrate the real external service or internal component, replacing the simulated call.  
  * **Integration Tests:** Develop robust integration tests for this component.

* **Proposed Next Steps:**  
  * **Install Dependencies:** Identify and install the necessary Python libraries for GARCH calculation (e.g., arch).  
  * **Implement GARCH Calculation:** Replace the simulated logic with a robust, real-time GARCH calculation.  
  * **Validation:** Validate the GARCH calculations against known financial data.  
* **Line:** 3244,11  
* **Current Comment:** \# For now, return None to indicate no data available  
* **Problem/Context:** This indicates a scenario where data is expected but currently unavailable, leading to a None return. This can cause issues downstream if not handled explicitly.  
* **Proposed Next Steps:**  
  * **Data Source Integration:** Ensure the data source providing this information is correctly integrated and provides data.  
  * **Clearer No-Data Handling:** Instead of None, consider returning an empty collection (e.g., \[\]) or raising a specific exception if the absence of data is an error condition.  
* **Line:** 3297,15  
* **Current Comment:** \# For now, we don't have a direct storage mechanism for this  
* **Problem/Context:** A specific type of data (unspecified in the snippet, but likely related to monitoring metrics or alerts) is not being persisted due to a lack of a storage mechanism.  
* **Proposed Next Steps:**  
  * **Identify Storage Needs:** Determine the appropriate storage solution (e.g., database, InfluxDB, file system) for this specific data.  
  * **Implement Persistence:** Develop the necessary DAL components and logic to store this data reliably.

## **VII. Portfolio Management**

* **Line:** 125,11  
* **Current Comment:** \# For now, let's assume it just logs the number of active positions.  
* **Problem/Context:** The current implementation for managing active positions is limited to just logging, rather than actively managing or verifying the state of positions.  
* **Proposed Next Steps:**  
  * **Active Position Management:** Implement full logic to actively track, update, and reconcile active positions with the exchange.  
  * **State Machine:** Consider a state machine for position lifecycle management (e.g., Open, Closed, Pending Adjustment).  
* **Line:** 392,20  
* **Current Comment:** \# For now, assume we create a new one if the existing is inactive.  
* **Problem/Context:** This implies a simplified logic for handling position creation or activation, potentially overlooking complex scenarios or requiring explicit checks.  
* **Proposed Next Steps:**  
  * **Refine Position Logic:** Clearly define the conditions for creating a new position versus reactivating or adjusting an existing one. Avoid implicit assumptions.  
  * **Error Handling:** Add checks for unexpected states (e.g., attempting to activate an already active position).  
* **Line:** 407,11  
* **Current Comment:** \# For now, ID will be auto-generated by DB if not provided.  
* **Problem/Context:** While common, relying solely on auto-generated IDs for positions might lead to issues in distributed systems or during backtesting if explicit ID management is required.  
* **Proposed Next Steps:**  
  * **Strategy for ID Generation:** Decide if a more explicit ID generation strategy is needed (e.g., UUIDs generated by the application) to ensure uniqueness and traceability across services, even before database persistence.  
* **Line:** 433,30  
* **Current Comment:** raise \# Re-raise for now  
* **Problem/Context:** A generic raise without specific error handling means that exceptions are not being caught, processed, or logged properly at this level.  
* **Proposed Next Steps:**  
  * **Specific Exception Handling:** Catch the appropriate exceptions, log them with context, and re-raise a more specific or custom exception if necessary for higher-level handling.  
  * **Error Recovery:** Implement a recovery or retry mechanism if the error is transient.  
* **Line:** 439,54  
* **Current Comment:** \# Or, iterate all positions if not too many. For now, simplified:  
* **Problem/Context:** This indicates a simplified approach to iterating positions, possibly suggesting that for a large number of positions, this method would be inefficient.  
* **Proposed Next Steps:**  
  * **Optimized Position Iteration:** Implement a more efficient method for iterating or querying positions, especially for large portfolios (e.g., pagination, indexed queries).  
  * **Performance Considerations:** Analyze the performance impact of this iteration as the number of positions grows.  
* **Line:** 451,7  
* **Current Comment:** \# For now, keeping if the internal logic still uses them to construct TradeInfo objects if needed.  
* **Problem/Context:** This suggests redundant data or objects are being kept "just in case," indicating potential code smells or unclear responsibilities.

  * **Comprehensive Adjustment Handling:** Extend the saving mechanism to handle all types of reconciliation adjustments (automatic, manual, system-generated) consistently.  
  * **Audit Trail:** Ensure a comprehensive audit trail is maintained for all adjustments.  
* **Line:** 1387,15  
* **Current Comment:** \# For now, let's assume it can fetch the model or we adapt.  
* **Problem/Context:** This implies a weak link in fetching or adapting a model within the reconciliation process, relying on an assumption that might not hold true.  
* **Proposed Next Steps:**  
  * **Robust Model Retrieval:** Implement explicit and robust logic for fetching the correct model (e.g., from a model registry) based on reconciliation context.  
  * **Adaptation Strategy:** Clearly define how the system adapts if the expected model is unavailable or in an incompatible format.

## **VIII. Prediction Service**

### **gal\_friday/prediction\_service.py**

* **Line:** 1376,19  
* **Current Comment:** \# For now, we pass it as np.nan.  
* **Problem/Context:** Missing or unavailable data is currently being passed as np.nan (Not a Number) to the prediction model. While common, this might mask underlying data quality issues or lead to suboptimal predictions if not handled specifically by the model.  
* **Proposed Next Steps:**  
  * **Robust Imputation:** Implement a more sophisticated data imputation strategy for missing values within the prediction pipeline, potentially leveraging the feature\_imputation module.  
  * **Model Compatibility:** Verify that the prediction models are robust to np.nan or that imputation occurs upstream.

* **Proposed Next Steps:**  
  * **Populate with Real Data:** Implement the logic to fetch and return actual data from configured market data providers.  
* **Line:** 579,30  
* **Current Comment:** \# Fallback to linear for now  
* **Problem/Context:** The system uses a simplified linear interpolation as a fallback, possibly for price data. This might not be accurate or robust enough for all scenarios.  
* **Proposed Next Steps:**  
  * **Review Interpolation Strategy:** Evaluate if linear interpolation is appropriate for all use cases. Consider more advanced interpolation methods if higher accuracy is needed (e.g., cubic spline, nearest neighbor).  
  * **Define Fallback Conditions:** Clearly define when and why this fallback is used and under what conditions it might be insufficient.  
* **Line:** 585,30  
* **Current Comment:** \# Fallback to linear for now  
* **Problem/Context:** Another instance of linear interpolation fallback, suggesting a systemic issue or a pervasive simplified approach.

* **Proposed Next Steps:**  
  * **Integrate Historical Data Service:** Connect the feature engine to the historical\_data\_service to fetch and process actual historical market data.  
  * **Implement Advanced Analysis:** Develop and implement robust algorithms for historical analysis, moving beyond simple OHLCV patterns.  
* **Line:** 4206,15  
* **Current Comment:** \# For now, use simplified cross-feature relationships  
* **Problem/Context:** Cross-feature relationships (how different features interact) are currently simplified, which might limit the predictive power of the models.  
* **Proposed Next Steps:**  
  * **Advanced Feature Interaction:** Explore and implement more complex and meaningful cross-feature relationships (e.g., interaction terms, polynomial features, non-linear transformations).  
  * **Feature Importance Analysis:** Use techniques to identify important feature interactions.

### **gal\_friday/main.py**

* **Line:** 1163,50  
* **Current Comment:** \# Note: Using standard formatter for now. For true JSON, need jsonlogger library.  
* **Problem/Context:** Logging is using a standard formatter instead of a JSON formatter, which is crucial for structured logging and easier integration with log aggregation systems.  
* **Proposed Next Steps:**  
  * **Integrate python-json-logger:** Install and configure the python-json-logger library to enable JSON-formatted logging.  
  * **Standardize Logging:** Ensure all logs are consistently formatted in JSON for better observability.  
* **Line:** 1212,71  
* **Current Comment:** self.services: list\[Any\] \= \[\] \# UP006: List \-\> list; Use Any for now, can refine later  
* **Problem/Context:** The services list is typed as list\[Any\], which is a weak type hint. While acceptable for initial development, it sacrifices type safety.  
* **Proposed Next Steps:**  
  * **Refine Type Hints:** Replace Any with specific protocol types or concrete class types for the services, improving type checking and code clarity.  
  * **Dependency Injection:** Consider a dependency injection framework to manage service dependencies.  
* **Line:** 1760,11  
* **Current Comment:** \# For now, these init methods are called; they would need internal updates  
* **Problem/Context:** Initialization methods are currently called in a simplified manner, implying that their internal logic or external dependencies might require further refinement or a more structured initialization flow.  
* **Proposed Next Steps:**  
  * **Review Initialization Logic:** Evaluate each init method to ensure it performs all necessary setup, handles dependencies correctly, and is resilient to errors.  
  * **Structured Startup:** Implement a more structured application startup process (e.g., using a dependency graph or service orchestrator).

## **XII. Training Script**

### **scripts/train\_initial\_model.py**

* **Line:** 427,57  
* **Current Comment:** \# this function. Simplified: fit only on train data for now  
* **Problem/Context:** The model fitting process is simplified to only use training data, potentially overlooking validation or testing data during initial fitting, which is crucial for preventing overfitting and evaluating generalization.  
* **Proposed Next Steps:**  
  * **Train/Validation/Test Split:** Ensure a proper train, validation, and test split is applied during model fitting.  
  * **Cross-Validation:** Implement cross-validation techniques for more robust model evaluation during training.  
  * **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Incorporate hyperparameter tuning with validation data.

## **XIII. Tests**

### **tests/unit/test\_feature\_engine\_pipeline\_construction.py**

* **Line:** 224,7  
* **Current Comment:** \# For now, we confirm default is applied.  
* **Problem/Context:** A test specifically confirms that a default value is applied, which might indicate that the actual behavior or a more complex scenario isn't fully tested.  
* **Proposed Next Steps:**  
  * **Comprehensive Testing:** Expand the test to cover various scenarios beyond just default application, such as custom configurations, invalid inputs, and interactions with other components.

### **tests/test\_integration.py**

* **Line:** 277,11  
* **Current Comment:** \# For now, just verify the test framework  
* **Problem/Context:** An integration test is currently only verifying the test framework itself, rather than performing actual integration tests of the system components.  
* **Proposed Next Steps:**  
  * **Implement Actual Integration Tests:** Develop comprehensive integration tests that simulate real-world scenarios, verify data flow between components, and assert end-to-end system behavior.  
  * **Remove Framework Verification:** Delete the "test framework verification" once proper integration tests are in place.
