# Decide on Order Model Relationship in Position Model

## Task ID
**POSITION-001**

## Priority
**Medium**

## Epic
**Data Model & Relationship Design**

## Story
As a developer working with position and order data, I need a clear decision on whether to add a relationship between Position and Order models so that I can properly track order history and position lifecycle.

## Problem Statement
Line 43 in `gal_friday/dal/models/position.py` contains commented code about adding a relationship to the Order model. This architectural decision needs to be made and either implemented or removed to maintain clean code.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Analyze the current Position and Order model structures
- [ ] Determine if a relationship between Position and Order is beneficial
- [ ] Evaluate performance implications of adding the relationship
- [ ] Consider use cases where order history per position is needed
- [ ] Make a decision: implement the relationship or remove commented code
- [ ] If implementing, ensure proper foreign key constraints and indexes
- [ ] If removing, clean up commented code and document the decision

## Technical Requirements
- Review line 43 in `gal_friday/dal/models/position.py`
- Analyze existing Order model structure and relationships
- Consider database performance implications
- Evaluate query patterns for position and order data
- Ensure proper SQLAlchemy relationship configuration if implemented
- Add appropriate database migrations if schema changes are needed

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Decision is made on whether to implement the relationship
- [ ] If implemented: relationship is properly configured with foreign keys
- [ ] If implemented: database migration is created and tested
- [ ] If removed: commented code is cleaned up
- [ ] Decision is documented with rationale
- [ ] Unit tests verify the model behavior
- [ ] Integration tests pass with any schema changes
- [ ] Code review completed and approved

## Dependencies
- Understanding of position and order lifecycle workflows
- Knowledge of database query patterns in the application
- Performance requirements for position tracking

## Estimated Effort
**Story Points: 5**

## Risk Assessment
**Medium Risk** - Database schema changes could require migration planning and testing

## Implementation Notes
```python
# Example of relationship implementation
class Position(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'positions'
    
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    # ... other fields
    
    # If implementing relationship:
    orders = relationship("Order", back_populates="position", 
                         cascade="all, delete-orphan")

class Order(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'orders'
    
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    position_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('positions.id'))
    # ... other fields
    
    position = relationship("Position", back_populates="orders")
```
