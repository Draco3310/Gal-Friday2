# Expand TypedDict with Expected Kwargs in Execution Handler Interface

## Task ID
**EXEC-INTERFACE-001**

## Priority
**Medium**

## Epic
**Type Safety & Interface Design**

## Story
As a developer working with the execution handler interface, I need properly defined TypedDict structures with expected kwargs so that I can have better type safety and clearer API contracts.

## Problem Statement
The execution handler interface contains a TypedDict with example code and pass statements at lines 147-148. This needs to be expanded with proper kwargs definition or removed if unused, improving type safety and API clarity.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Analyze current TypedDict usage in the execution handler interface
- [ ] Determine what kwargs are expected to be passed to the interface
- [ ] Expand TypedDict with proper field definitions and types
- [ ] Add comprehensive docstrings explaining each field
- [ ] Ensure type hints are accurate and helpful for IDE support
- [ ] Verify integration with existing execution handler implementations
- [ ] Remove placeholder "Example" comments and pass statements

## Technical Requirements
- Review lines 147-148 in `gal_friday/interfaces/execution_handler_interface.py`
- Define proper TypedDict structure with required and optional fields
- Ensure type compatibility with existing execution handler methods
- Add validation for required fields where appropriate
- Follow Python typing best practices for dictionary structures

## Definition of Done
- [ ] TypedDict is properly defined with all expected fields
- [ ] All fields have appropriate type annotations
- [ ] Documentation explains the purpose and usage of each field
- [ ] Example code is removed or converted to proper documentation
- [ ] Type checking passes without warnings
- [ ] Integration tests verify the interface works correctly
- [ ] Code review completed and approved

## Dependencies
- Understanding of execution handler workflow and parameters
- Knowledge of order management and execution patterns

## Estimated Effort
**Story Points: 3**

## Risk Assessment
**Low Risk** - Improves type safety without changing runtime behavior

## Implementation Notes
```python
# Example of proper TypedDict structure
class ExecutionKwargs(TypedDict, total=False):
    order_id: str
    symbol: str
    side: Literal['buy', 'sell']
    quantity: Decimal
    price: Optional[Decimal]
    order_type: OrderType
    time_in_force: TimeInForce
    client_order_id: Optional[str]
    stop_price: Optional[Decimal]
    iceberg_qty: Optional[Decimal]
```
