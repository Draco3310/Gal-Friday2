# Original TODO: Line 848 - Add startup time tracking if needed
# Context: Within the data staleness check logic (e.g., _check_data_staleness method or similar)

# --- Dependencies/Collaborators ---
# - datetime from datetime module: For capturing timestamps.
# - LoggerService: For logging.

# --- Pseudocode Implementation ---

# 1. Add Startup Timestamp to MonitoringService
#    In the __init__ method of MonitoringService:
#
#    CLASS MonitoringService:
#        DEF __init__(self, ..., logger_service: LoggerService, ...):
#            # ... other initializations ...
#            self.logger = logger_service
#            self._service_start_time = None # Initialize to None
#            self._source = self.__class__.__name__ # Existing attribute
#            self._data_staleness_threshold_s = ... # Existing attribute, loaded from config
#            # ... other initializations ...
#
#    In the start method of MonitoringService (or wherever the service becomes fully operational):
#
#    ASYNC DEF start(self):
#        IF self._is_running: # Assuming an _is_running flag
#            RETURN
#        ENDIF
#        # ... other start logic ...
#        self._service_start_time = datetime.utcnow() # Record the time when the service (or its main loop) starts
#        self.logger.info(f"{self._source} started at {self._service_start_time}.", source_module=self._source)
#        self._is_running = True
#        # ... start main monitoring loop ...
#    END ASYNC DEF

# 2. Modify Data Staleness Check Logic
#    The existing logic (around line 845-855 in the provided code snippet for monitoring_service.py) is:
#    # IF last_ts is None:
#    #     self.logger.warning("No market data timestamp found for active pair %s.", pair, source_module=self._source)
#    #     # Only consider stale if system has been running longer than staleness threshold
#    #     # This prevents false alerts during startup
#    #     # TODO: Add startup time tracking if needed
#    # ELIF (now - last_ts).total_seconds() > self._data_staleness_threshold_s:
#    #     stale_pairs.append(pair)
#    #     # ... logging ...
#
#    Revised logic within the method that checks data staleness (e.g., _check_data_staleness):
#
#    ASYNC DEF _check_data_staleness(self): # Or similar method
#        # ... (other parts of the method, like getting `active_trading_pairs` and `self._last_market_data_timestamps`) ...
#        now = datetime.utcnow()
#        stale_pairs = []
#        potentially_stale_awaiting_initial_data = [] # New list for clarity
#
#        IF self._service_start_time IS None:
#            self.logger.warning("Service start time not recorded. Staleness check might be unreliable during initial startup phase.", source_module=self._source)
#            # Fallback: proceed without startup grace period or return if too risky
#            system_uptime_seconds = float('inf') # Effectively disables startup grace period
#        ELSE:
#            system_uptime_seconds = (now - self._service_start_time).total_seconds()
#        ENDIF
#
#        FOR pair IN active_trading_pairs: # Assuming this list exists
#            last_ts = self._last_market_data_timestamps.get(pair)
#
#            IF last_ts IS None:
#                # Case 1: No data ever received for this pair
#                IF system_uptime_seconds < self._data_staleness_threshold_s:
#                    # Startup grace period is active for this pair as no data has been seen yet.
#                    self.logger.info(
#                        "Awaiting initial market data for active pair %s. System uptime: %.2fs.",
#                        pair,
#                        system_uptime_seconds,
#                        source_module=self._source
#                    )
#                    potentially_stale_awaiting_initial_data.append(pair) # Track separately if needed for different handling
#                    # Do NOT add to `stale_pairs` yet.
#                ELSE:
#                    # Startup grace period has passed, and still no data. This is a concern.
#                    self.logger.warning(
#                        "No market data received for active pair %s after initial grace period (%.2fs). Marking as stale.",
#                        pair,

#                        source_module=self._source
#                    )
#                    stale_pairs.append(pair) # Now it's considered genuinely stale
#                ENDIF
#            ELSE IF (now - last_ts).total_seconds() > self._data_staleness_threshold_s:
#                # Case 2: Data was received, but it's now older than the staleness threshold
#                stale_pairs.append(pair)
#                warning_msg = (
#                    f"Market data for {pair} is stale (last update: {last_ts}, "
#                    f"threshold: {self._data_staleness_threshold_s}s, current age: {(now - last_ts).total_seconds():.2f}s)"
#                )
#                self.logger.warning(warning_msg, source_module=self._source)
#            ELSE:
#                # Data is present and not stale
#                self.logger.debug(f"Market data for {pair} is current (last update: {last_ts}).", source_module=self._source)
#            ENDIF
#        ENDFOR
#
#        IF stale_pairs:

#            self.logger.info(f"Identified stale pairs: {stale_pairs}", source_module=self._source)
#        ENDIF

#    END ASYNC DEF

# --- Considerations ---
# - Clock Synchronization: Assumes `datetime.utcnow()` is consistent across the system.
#   This is generally true for a single machine, but important if different components run on different hosts.
# - Granularity of Startup Time:
#   - `MonitoringService` startup: Good for checks within the `MonitoringService`.
#   - Overall Application startup: If the `DataIngestor` or other upstream services take a long time to initialize
#     *before* `MonitoringService` starts its checks, this might also need to be considered.
#     A simple approach is for `MonitoringService` to only start its active monitoring loop (and thus set `_service_start_time`)
#     after receiving a signal that essential upstream services are ready.
#     Alternatively, the "grace period" (`self._data_staleness_threshold_s`) could be made generously long
#     to implicitly cover overall system startup, but specific service-level startup time is more precise.
# - Configuration of Grace Period: The `_data_staleness_threshold_s` is effectively used as the grace period
#   in this pseudocode when `last_ts` is `None`. This seems reasonable, as it implies the system should have
#   received data within that time if it's going to.
#   Alternatively, a separate `startup_grace_period_s` could be configured.
# - Definition of "Service Started": The `_service_start_time` should be set when the service is genuinely ready
#   to begin its monitoring duties, typically at the beginning of its main operational loop or `start()` method.
#   The `await asyncio.sleep(0.1)` from the original TODO context might have been a placeholder for allowing
#   other tasks to initialize; the startup time should be recorded after such initializations if they are blocking
#   the service's own readiness.
