# The TYPE_CHECKING block should now only be used for genuine type-hint-only
# forward references if absolutely necessary to break typing cycles,
# NOT for defining runtime placeholders.
# The original TYPE_CHECKING block in risk_manager.py was:
# if TYPE_CHECKING:
#     from .exchange_info_service import ExchangeInfoService
#     from .market_price_service import MarketPriceService
#     from .portfolio_manager import PortfolioManager
# Since these are now directly imported above, this specific TYPE_CHECKING block
# for these imports might no longer be needed unless there are other true circular
# dependencies for typing purposes. If direct imports work, it can be removed or left empty.
if TYPE_CHECKING:
    # Example: from .some_other_module_creating_cycle import SomeTypeForHintingOnly
    pass

# CRITICAL: The `else` block that previously defined placeholder classes for
# `PortfolioManager`, `MarketPriceService`, and `ExchangeInfoService`
# (lines 63-132 in the provided risk_manager.py snippet)
# MUST BE REMOVED for production code.
# The RiskManager class will use the directly imported classes listed above.


# ... (Rest of the RiskManager class definition, using the directly imported services) ...
# Example of how RiskManager's __init__ would now look:
#
# class RiskManager:
#     def __init__(

#         config_manager: ConfigManager, # Added

#         feature_registry_client: Optional[FeatureRegistryClient] = None, # Made optional if not always needed
#         # ... other parameters ...
