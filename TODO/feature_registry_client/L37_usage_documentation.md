# Provide Real Usage Documentation for Feature Registry Client

## Task ID
**FEATURE-REGISTRY-001**

## Priority
**Medium**

## Epic
**Documentation & Developer Experience**

## Story
As a developer integrating with the feature registry client, I need comprehensive usage documentation and examples so that I can effectively utilize the feature registry system in my applications.

## Problem Statement
~~Line 37 in `gal_friday/core/feature_registry_client.py` contains placeholder example code that needs to be replaced with real usage documentation or removed entirely. This affects developer understanding and proper integration.~~

**COMPLETED** - The placeholder content has been replaced with comprehensive, enterprise-grade documentation including multiple usage patterns, integration examples, and troubleshooting guidance.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Review current placeholder example section in the feature registry client
- [x] Create comprehensive usage documentation with real examples
- [x] Include common integration patterns and best practices
- [x] Add error handling examples and troubleshooting guidance
- [x] Provide code samples for typical feature registry operations
- [x] Remove placeholder content and replace with production-ready documentation
- [x] Add API reference documentation for all public methods

## Technical Requirements
- [x] Review line 37 in `gal_friday/core/feature_registry_client.py`
- [x] Create comprehensive docstrings with usage examples
- [x] Document all public methods and their parameters
- [x] Include type hints and return value documentation
- [x] Add examples for common use cases (registration, retrieval, updates)
- [x] Follow Python documentation standards (Google/NumPy style)

## Definition of Done
- [x] All placeholder example code is removed or converted to proper documentation
- [x] Comprehensive usage examples are provided for main functionality
- [x] API documentation covers all public methods and classes
- [x] Error handling patterns are documented with examples
- [x] Integration patterns are clearly explained
- [x] Documentation is reviewed for accuracy and completeness
- [x] Code review completed and approved

## Dependencies
- Understanding of feature registry architecture and capabilities
- Knowledge of client usage patterns and requirements
- Integration requirements from other system components

## Estimated Effort
**Story Points: 3**

## Risk Assessment
**Low Risk** - Documentation improvement with no runtime changes

## Implementation Summary

**TASK COMPLETED** ✅

The Feature Registry Client documentation has been completely overhauled with enterprise-grade documentation including:

### Main Class Documentation Enhanced:
