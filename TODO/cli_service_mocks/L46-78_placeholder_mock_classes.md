# Replace Placeholder Mock Classes in CLI Service Mocks

## Task ID
**CLI-MOCKS-001**

## Priority
**Medium**

## Epic
**Code Quality & Production Readiness**

## Story
As a developer working with the CLI service testing framework, I need proper mock implementations to replace placeholder classes so that I can write reliable tests and maintain code quality standards.

## Problem Statement
The CLI service mocks module contains placeholder mock classes (lines 46-78) that need to be replaced with either proper test doubles or production implementations. Current placeholder implementations don't provide meaningful testing capabilities.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Analyze current placeholder mock classes and determine their intended purpose
- [ ] Replace placeholder implementations with proper mock objects using unittest.mock or similar
- [ ] Ensure mock classes provide realistic behavior for testing scenarios
- [ ] Add proper documentation explaining the purpose and usage of each mock class
- [ ] Verify that existing tests continue to pass with new mock implementations
- [ ] Add type hints and proper error handling to mock classes
- [ ] Create usage examples demonstrating how to use the mocks in tests

## Technical Requirements
- Review lines 46-78 in `gal_friday/cli_service_mocks.py`
- Implement proper mock classes with realistic behavior
- Follow Python testing best practices for mock objects
- Ensure thread safety if mocks will be used in concurrent tests
- Add comprehensive docstrings explaining mock behavior

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All placeholder mock classes are replaced with functional implementations
- [ ] Mock classes include proper type annotations
- [ ] Documentation clearly explains each mock's purpose and usage
- [ ] Unit tests verify mock behavior works as expected
- [ ] Code review completed and approved
- [ ] Integration tests pass with new mock implementations

## Dependencies
- Understanding of CLI service testing requirements
- Knowledge of existing test patterns in the codebase

## Estimated Effort
**Story Points: 5**

## Risk Assessment
**Low-Medium Risk** - Primarily affects testing infrastructure but could impact CI/CD if tests break

## Implementation Notes
```python
# Example of proper mock structure
class MockConfigManager:
    def __init__(self, config_data: dict = None):
        self._config = config_data or {}
    
    def get(self, key: str, default=None):
        return self._config.get(key, default)
    
    def validate(self) -> bool:
        # Realistic validation logic
        return True
```
