# AI Agent Handoff Prompt - Gal-Friday2 Production System

## üöÄ Context for Next Agent

You are taking over work on **Gal-Friday2**, an enterprise-grade financial trading system. This is a **production-ready system** with all critical functionality complete.

### Current Status
- **‚úÖ 31 major implementations completed** with enterprise-grade solutions
- **‚úÖ System is production-ready** for live trading
- **üîß 20 technical debt items remain** (non-critical optimizations)
- **üìÅ All documentation updated** with clear action plans

### What Was Just Completed
The previous agent successfully:
1. Implemented ExecutionHandler WebSocket with bidirectional order ID mapping
2. Completed all critical TODOs (31 total) including:
   - Enterprise WebSocket connections with reconnection logic
   - Comprehensive order validation and batch processing
   - Production-grade monitoring and risk management
   - Full Kraken API integration with rate limiting
   - InfluxDB time-series data storage
3. Reorganized TODO documentation into three clear files

### Key Documents to Review

1. **`TODO/Quick_Reference_Remaining_Work.md`** - Start here!
   - Shows all 20 remaining technical debt items
   - Organized by priority (üî¥ Must Fix, üü° Should Fix, üü¢ Nice to Have)
   - One-line format for easy tracking

2. **`TODO/Action_Plan_Next_Steps.md`** - Your implementation guide
   - Day-by-day breakdown of tasks
   - Specific code examples for each fix
   - Helpful commands for finding issues

3. **`TODO/Consolidated TODOs and Areas Requiring Attention for Gal-Friday2.md`**
   - Full context and history
   - Detailed explanation of completed work

### Your Mission

**Primary Goal**: Clean up remaining technical debt to achieve production excellence

**Priorities**:
1. **üî¥ Day 1-2**: Remove 5 placeholder files (monitoring_service.py, risk_manager.py, etc.)
2. **üü° Day 3**: Fix 3 hardcoded values (exchange names, magic numbers)
3. **üü¢ Day 4-5**: Implement 12 algorithm improvements (optional but recommended)

### Technical Context

**Architecture**:
- Async Python with asyncio
- PostgreSQL + InfluxDB for data storage
- Kraken exchange integration
- WebSocket for real-time data
- Enterprise logging and monitoring

**Key Services**:
- ExecutionHandler (fully implemented with WebSocket)
- PredictionService (confidence floors, graceful shutdown)
- MonitoringService (risk management, volatility calculations)
- KrakenHistoricalDataService (complete API integration)

### Important Notes

1. **The system works** - Don't break existing functionality while cleaning technical debt
2. **Run tests** - After each change: `pytest tests/unit/ -v`
3. **Check dependencies** - Some files have circular import fixes in place
4. **Configuration-first** - Replace any hardcoded values with config parameters

### Quick Start Commands

```bash
# See what's left to do
cat TODO/Quick_Reference_Remaining_Work.md

# Find all placeholder code
grep -r "placeholder\|mock" gal_friday/ --include="*.py" -i | grep -v test

# Find "for now" comments
grep -r "for now" gal_friday/ --include="*.py" | grep -v test

# Run tests
pytest tests/unit/ -v
```

### Definition of Success

‚úÖ All 5 placeholder files cleaned up  
‚úÖ No hardcoded exchange names or magic numbers  
‚úÖ All "MVP" references removed  
‚úÖ Tests passing  
‚úÖ Production deployment ready

**Remember**: The heavy lifting is done. You're doing the final polish on a production-ready system. Focus on code quality and maintainability rather than new features.

Good luck! üéØ
