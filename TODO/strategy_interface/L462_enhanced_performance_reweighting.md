# Enhance Performance-Based Reweighting with Statistical Analysis

## Task ID
**STRATEGY-INTERFACE-002**

## Priority
**High**

## Epic
**Strategy Optimization & Statistical Analysis**

## Story
As a developer working with strategy performance optimization, I need enhanced performance-based reweighting with statistical analysis and configurable weights so that strategy allocation can be dynamically adjusted based on rigorous performance metrics.

## Problem Statement
Line 462 in `gal_friday/interfaces/strategy_interface.py` contains simple performance-based reweighting that needs to be enhanced with statistical analysis or made configurable with documented weight calculation methods.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Analyze current simple performance-based reweighting implementation
- [ ] Implement statistical analysis methods for performance evaluation
- [ ] Add configurable weight calculation strategies
- [ ] Create performance metrics with statistical significance testing
- [ ] Add confidence intervals and risk-adjusted performance measures
- [ ] Replace simple reweighting with sophisticated statistical methods
- [ ] Add comprehensive backtesting for reweighting strategies

## Technical Requirements
- Review line 462 in `gal_friday/interfaces/strategy_interface.py`
- Implement statistical analysis using appropriate libraries (scipy, statsmodels)
- Add Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio, and other risk-adjusted metrics
- Create configurable reweighting algorithms
- Implement statistical significance testing for performance differences
- Add rolling window analysis and regime detection
- Include drawdown analysis and risk metrics

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Statistical analysis framework is implemented for performance evaluation
- [ ] Multiple reweighting strategies are available and configurable
- [ ] Performance metrics include statistical significance and confidence intervals
- [ ] Risk-adjusted performance measures are calculated and used
- [ ] Simple reweighting is replaced with statistically robust methods
- [ ] Backtesting validates reweighting strategy effectiveness
- [ ] Unit tests cover all statistical calculations
- [ ] Integration tests verify reweighting impact on trading performance
- [ ] Code review completed and approved

## Dependencies
- Understanding of financial statistics and performance metrics
- Knowledge of strategy performance evaluation methods
- Statistical analysis libraries and tools

## Estimated Effort
**Story Points: 10**

## Risk Assessment
**High Risk** - Performance-based reweighting directly affects capital allocation and trading results
